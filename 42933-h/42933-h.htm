<h3>DEFINITIONS OF HAPPINESS.</h3>

<p>1. The (Aristotelian) ideal of living well and happiness
are (practically) identical. Should we, on that
account, grant even to animals the privilege of achieving
happiness? Why might we not say that they live
well, if it be granted them, in their lives, to follow the
course of nature, without obstacles? For if to live
well consist either in pleasure (pleasant passions, as the
Epicureans taught), or in realizing one's own individual
aim (the Stoic ideal), then this living well is, in either
case, possible for animals, who can both enjoy pleasure,
and accomplish their peculiar aim. Thus singing birds
live a life desirable for them, if they enjoy pleasure,
and sing conformably to their nature. If further we
should define happiness as achieving the supreme purpose
towards which nature aspires (the Stoic ideal),
we should, even in this case, admit that animals share
in happiness when they accomplish this supreme purpose.
Then nature arouses in them no further desires,
because their whole career is completed, and their life
is filled from beginning to end.</p>

<h3>WHETHER PLANTS MAY BE TERMED HAPPY.</h3>

<p>There are no doubt some who may object to our
admitting to happiness living beings other than man.
They might even point out that on this basis happiness
could not be refused to even the lowest beings, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1020" id="Page_1020">1020</a></span>
plants: for they also live, their life also has a purpose,
by which they seek to fulfil their development. However,
it would seem rather unreasonable to say, that
living beings other than humans cannot possess happiness
by this mere reason that to us they seem pitiable.
Besides, it would be quite possible to deny to plants
what may be predicated of other living beings, on the
grounds that plants lack emotion. Some might hold
they are capable of happiness, on the strength of their
possessing life, for a being that lives can live well or
badly; and in this way we could say that they possess
or lack well-being, and bear, or do not bear fruits. If
(as Aristippus thought), pleasure is the goal of man,
and if to live well is constituted by enjoying it, it would
be absurd to claim that no living beings other than
man could live well. The same argument applies if we
define happiness as (a state of imperturbable tranquility,
by Epicurus called) ataraxy;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> or as (the Stoic
<span class="locked">ideal,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> of) living conformably to nature.</p>

<h3>LIVING WELL NEED NOT BE EXTENDED EVEN TO
ALL ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>2. Those who deny the privilege of living well to
plants, because these lack sensation, are not on that
account obliged to grant it to all animals. For, if sensation
consist in the knowledge of the experienced affection,
this affection must already be good before the occurrence
of the knowledge. For instance, the being
must be in a state conformable to nature even though
ignorant thereof. He must fulfil his proper function
even when he does not know it. He must possess
pleasure before perceiving it. Thus if, by the possession
of this pleasure, the being already possesses the
Good, he thereby possesses even well-being. What
need then is there to join thereto sensation, unless
indeed well-being be defined as sensation and knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1021" id="Page_1021">1021</a></span>
(of an affection or state of the soul) rather than
in the latter affection and state of the soul itself?</p>

<h3>EVEN THEY WHO DEFINE HAPPINESS AS SENSATION
SEEK HIGHER HAPPINESS.</h3>

<p>The Good would thus be reduced to no more than
sensation, or the actualization of the sense-life. In this
case, to possess it, it is sufficient to perceive irrespective
of the content of that perception. Other persons might
assert that goodness results from the union of these
two things: of the state of the soul, and of the knowledge
the soul has of it. If then the Good consist in the
perception of some particular state, we shall have to
ask how elements which, by themselves, are indifferent
could, by their union, constitute the good. Other
theories are that the Good consists in some particular
state, or in possession of some particular disposition,
and conscious enjoyment of the presence of the Good.
These would, however, still have to answer the question
whether, for good living, it be sufficient that the being
knows he possesses this state; or must he know not
only that this state is pleasant, but also that it is the
Good? If then it be necessary to realize that it is the
Good, the matter is one no longer of the function of
sensation, but of a faculty higher than the senses. To
live well, in this case, it will no longer be sufficient to
possess pleasure, but we shall have to know that
pleasure is the Good. The cause of happiness will not
be the presence of pleasure itself, but the power of
judging that pleasure is a good. Now judgment is
superior to affection; it is reason or intelligence, while
pleasure is only an affection, and what is irrational
could not be superior to reason. How would reason
forget itself to recognize as superior what is posited
in a genus opposed to it? These men who deny happiness
to plants, who explain it as some form of sensation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1022" id="Page_1022">1022</a></span>
seems to us, in spite of themselves, to be really
seeking happiness of a higher nature, and to consider
it as this better thing which is found only in a completer
life.</p>

<h3>NOT EVEN REASON IS A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION
OF LIVING WELL.</h3>

<p>There is a greater chance of being right in the
opinion that happiness consists in the reasonable life,
instead of mere life, even though united to sensation.
Still even this theory must explain why happiness
should be the privilege of the reasonable animal.
Should we add to the idea of an animal the quality of
being reasonable, because reason is more sagacious,
more skilful in discovering, and in procuring the objects
necessary to satisfy the first needs of nature?
Would you esteem reason just as highly if it were incapable
of discovering, or procuring these objects? If
we value reason only for the objects it aids us in getting,
happiness might very well belong to the very irrational
beings, if they are, without reason, able to procure
themselves the things necessary to the satisfaction of
the first needs of their nature. In this case, reason will
be nothing more than an instrument. It will not be
worth seeking out for itself, and its perfection, in which
virtue has been shown to consist, will be of little importance.
The opposite theory would be that reason
does not owe its value to its ability to procure for us
objects necessary to the satisfaction of the first needs
of nature, but that it deserves to be sought out for
itself. But even here we would have to explain its
function, its nature, and set forth how it becomes perfect.
If it were to be improvable, it must not be
defined as the contemplation of sense-objects, for its
perfection and essence (being) consist in a different
(and higher) function. It is not among the first needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1023" id="Page_1023">1023</a></span>
of nature, nor among the objects necessary to the
satisfaction of its needs; it has nothing to do with them,
being far superior. Otherwise, these philosophers
would be hard pressed to explain its value. Until they
discover some nature far superior to the class of objects
with which they at present remain, they will have
to remain where it suits them to be, ignorant of what
good living is, and both how to reach that goal, and
to what beings it is possible.</p>

<h3>HAPPINESS DEPENDS EXCLUSIVELY ON INTERIOR
CHARACTERISTICS.</h3>

<p>3. Dismissing these theories, we return to our own
definition of happiness. We do not necessarily make
life synonymous with happiness by attributing happiness
to a living being. Otherwise, we would be implying
that all living beings can achieve it, and we
would be admitting to real complete enjoyment thereof
all those who possessed that union and identity which
all living beings are naturally capable of possessing.
Finally, it would be difficult to grant this privilege to
the reasonable being, while refusing it to the brute;
for both equally possess life. They should, therefore,
be capable of achieving happiness&mdash;for, on this hypothesis,
happiness could be no more than a kind of
life. Consequently, the philosophers who make it consist
in the rational life, not in the life common to all
beings, do not perceive that they implicitly suppose
that happiness is something different from life. They
are then obliged to say that happiness resides in a pure
quality, in the rational faculty. But the subject (to
which they should refer happiness) is the rational life,
since happiness can belong only to the totality (of life
joined to reason). They therefore, really limit the life
they speak of to a certain kind of life; not that they
have the right to consider these two kinds of life (life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1024" id="Page_1024">1024</a></span>
in general, and rational life) as being ranked alike, as
both members of a single division would be, but another
kind of distinction might be established between
them, such as when we say that one thing is prior, and
the other posterior. Since "life" may be understood in
different senses, and as it possesses different degrees,
and since by mere verbal similarity life may be equally
predicated of plants and of irrational animals, and
since its differences consist in being more or less complete,
analogy demands a similar treatment of "living
well." If, by its life, a being be the image of some
other being, by its happiness it will also be the image
of the happiness of this other being. If happiness be
the privilege of complete life, the being that possesses
a complete life will also alone possess happiness; for it
possesses what is best since, in the order of these existences,
the best is possession of the essence (being) and
perfection of life. Consequently, the Good is not anything
incidental, for no subject could owe its good to
a quality that would be derived from elsewhere. What
indeed could be added to complete life, to render it
excellent?</p>

<h3>THE GOOD CONSISTS IN INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>Our own definition of the Good, interested as we
are not in its cause, but in its essence, is that the perfect
life, that is genuine and real, consists in intelligence.
The other kinds of life are imperfect. They offer no
more than the image of life. They are not Life in its
fulness and purity. As we have often said they are not
life, rather than its contrary. In one word, since all
living beings are derived from one and the same Principle,
and since they do not possess an equal degree
of life, this principle must necessarily be the primary
Life, and perfectness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1025" id="Page_1025">1025</a></span></p>

<h3>HAPPINESS MUST BE SOMETHING HUMAN.</h3>

<p>4. If man be capable of possessing perfect Life, he
is happy as soon as he possesses it. If it were otherwise,
if the perfect life pertained to the divinities alone,
to them alone also would happiness belong. But since
we attribute happiness to men, we shall have to set
forth in what that which procures it consists. I repeat,
what results from our former considerations, namely,
that man has perfect Life when, besides the sense-life,
he possesses reason and true intelligence. But is man as
such stranger to the perfect Life, and does he possess
it as something alien (to his essential being)? No,
for no man lacks happiness entirely, either actually or
even potentially. But shall we consider happiness as a
part of the man, and that he in himself is the perfect
form of life? We had better think that he who is a
stranger to the perfect Life possesses only a part of
happiness, as he possesses happiness only potentially;
but that he who possesses the perfect Life in actuality,
and he who has succeeded in identifying himself with
it, alone is happy. All the other things, no more than
envelope him (as the Stoics would say), and could not
be considered as parts of him, since they surround him
in spite of himself. They would belong to him as parts
of himself, if they were joined to him by the result of
his will. What is the Good for a man who finds himself
in this condition? By the perfect life which he
possesses, he himself is his own good. The principle
(the Good in itself) which is superior (to the perfect
Life) is the cause of the good which is in him; for we
must not confuse the Good in itself&mdash;and the good
in man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1026" id="Page_1026">1026</a></span></p>

<h3>WE KNOW WE HAVE REACHED HAPPINESS WHEN
WE NO MORE DESIRE ANYTHING.</h3>

<p>That the man who has achieved perfect Life possesses
happiness is proved by his no longer desiring
anything. What more could he desire? He could
not desire anything inferior; he is united to the best;
he, therefore, has fulness of life. If he be virtuous
he is fully happy, and fully possesses the Good, for no
good thing escapes him. What he seeks is sought only
by necessity, less for him than for some of the things
which belong to him. He seeks it for the body that
is united to him; and though this body be endowed
with life, what relates to his needs is not characteristic
of the real man. The latter knows it, and what he
grants to his body, he grants without in any way departing
from his own characteristic life. His happiness
will, therefore, not be diminished in adversity, because
he continues to possess veritable life. If he lose
relatives or friends, he knows the nature of death, and
besides those whom it strikes down know it also if they
were virtuous. Though he may allow himself to be
afflicted by the fate of these relatives or friends, the
affliction will not reach the intimate part of his nature;
the affliction will be felt only by that part of the soul
which lacks reason, and whose suffering the man will
not share.</p>

<h3>MEN MUST SEEK THEIR HAPPINESS IN THAT OF
EACH OF THE PARTS OF THEIR NATURE.</h3>

<p>5. It has often been objected that we should
reckon with the bodily pains, the diseases, the obstacles
which may hinder action, cases of unconsciousness,
which might result from certain philtres and diseases
(as the Peripatetics <span class="locked">objected<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span>). Under these conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1027" id="Page_1027">1027</a></span>
they say, the sage could not live well, and be
happy&mdash;without either mentioning poverty and lack of
recognition. All these evils, not forgetting the famous
misfortunes of <span class="locked">Priam,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> justify serious objections. Indeed,
even if the sage endured all these evils (as indeed
he easily does), they would none the less be contrary
to his will; and happy life must necessarily be one that
conforms to our will. The sage is not only a soul
endowed with particular dispositions; the body also
must be comprised within his personality (as also
thought the Pythagorean <span class="locked">Archytas<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span>). This assertion
seems reasonable so far as the passions of the body
are felt by the man himself, and as they suggest desires
and aversions to him. If then pleasure be an
element of happiness, how could the man afflicted by
the blows of fate and by pains still be happy, even if he
were virtuous? To be happy, the divinities need only
to enjoy perfect life; but men, having their soul united
to a lower part, must seek their happiness in the life
of each of these two parts that compose him, and not
exclusively in one of the two, even though it were the
higher. Indeed, as soon as one of them suffers, the
other one, in spite of its superiority, finds its actions
hindered. Otherwise we shall have to regard neither
the body, nor the sensations that flow from it; and
to seek only what by itself could suffice to procure
happiness, independently of the body.</p>

<h3>NECESSARY THINGS ARE THOSE WHOSE POSSESSION
IS UNCONSCIOUS.</h3>

<p>6. If our exposition of the subject had defined
happiness as exemption from pain, sickness, reverses,
and great misfortunes, (we would have implied that)
it would be impossible for us to taste happiness while
exposed to one of those evils. But if happiness consist
in the possession of the real good, why should we
forget this good to consider its accessories? Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1028" id="Page_1028">1028</a></span>
in the appreciation of this good, should we seek things
which are not among the number of its elements? If
it consisted in a union of the true goods with those
things which alone are necessary to our needs, or which
are so called, even without being such, we should have
to strive to possess the latter also. But as the goal of
man must be single and not manifold&mdash;for otherwise it
would be usual to say that he seeks his ends, rather
than the more common expression, his end&mdash;we shall
have to seek only what is most high and precious, what
the soul somehow wishes to include. Her inclination
and will cannot aspire to anything which is not the
sovereign good. Reason only avoids certain evils, and
seeks certain advantages, because it is provoked by
their presence; but it is not so led by nature. The
principal tendency of the soul is directed towards what
is best; when she possesses it, she is satisfied, and
stops; only then does she enjoy a life really conformable
to her will. Speaking of will <span class="locked">strictly,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> and not
with unjustifiable license, the task of the will is not to
procure things necessary to our needs (?) Of course
we judge that it is suitable to procure things that are
necessary, as we in general avoid evils. But the avoiding
of them is no aim desirable in itself; such would
rather be not to need to avoid them. This, for instance,
occurs when one possesses health and is exempt
from suffering. Which of these advantages most
attracts us? So long as we enjoy health, so long as
we do not suffer, it is little valued. Now advantages
which, when present, have no attraction for the soul,
and add nothing to her happiness, and which, when
absent, are sought as causes of the suffering arising
from the presence of their contraries, should reasonably
be called necessity rather than goods, and not be
reckoned among the elements of our goal. When they
are absent and replaced by their contraries, our goal
remains just what it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1029" id="Page_1029">1029</a></span></p>

<h3>EVILS WHICH THE WISE MAN CAN SUPPORT WITHOUT
DISTURBANCE OF HIS HAPPINESS.</h3>

<p>7. Why then does the happy man desire to enjoy
the presence of these advantages, and the absence of
their contraries? It must be because they contribute,
not to his happiness, but to his existence; because their
contraries tend to make him lose existence, hindering
the enjoyment of the good, without however removing
it. Besides, he who possesses what is best wishes to
possess it purely, without any mixture. Nevertheless,
when a foreign obstacle occurs, the good still persists
even in spite of this obstacle. In short, if some accident
happen to the happy man against his will, his
happiness is in no way affected thereby. Otherwise,
he would change and lose his happiness daily; as if,
for instance, he had to mourn a son, or if he lost some
of his possessions. Many events may occur against
his wish without disturbing him in the enjoyment of
the good he has attained. It may be objected that it
is the great misfortunes, and not trifling accidents
(which can disturb the happiness of the wise man).
Nevertheless, in human things, is there any great
enough not to be scorned by him who has climbed to
a principle superior to all, and who no longer depends
on lower things? Such a man will not be able to see
anything great in the favors of fortune, whatever they
be, as in being king, in commanding towns, or
peoples; in founding or building cities, even though he
himself should receive that glory; he will attach no
importance to the loss of his power, or even to the
ruin of his fatherland. If he consider all that as a
great evil, or even only as an evil, he will have a
ridiculous opinion. He will no longer be a virtuous
man; for, as Jupiter is my witness, he would be highly
valuing mere wood, or stones, birth, or death; while he
should insist on the incontestable truth that death is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1030" id="Page_1030">1030</a></span>
better than the corporeal life (as held by Herodotus).
Even though he were sacrificed, he would not consider
death any worse merely because it occurred at the feet
of the altars. Being buried is really of small importance,
for his body will rot as well above as below
ground (as thought Theodorus of Cyrene).<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Neither will
he grieve at being buried without pomp and vulgar
ostentation, and to have seemed unworthy of being
placed in a magnificent tomb. That would be smallness
of mind. If he were carried off as a captive, he
would still have a road open to leave life, in the case
that he should no longer be allowed to hope for happiness.
(Nor would he be troubled if the members
of his family, such as sons (?) and daughters (and
female relatives?) were carried off into captivity. If
he had arrived to the end of his life without seeing
such occurrences (we would indeed be surprised).
Would he leave this world supposing that such things
cannot happen? Such an opinion would be absurd.
Would he not have realized that his own kindred were
exposed to such dangers? The opinion that such
things could happen will not make him any less happy.
No, he will be happy even with that belief. He would
still be so even should that occur; he will indeed reflect
that such is the nature of this world, that one
must undergo such accidents, and submit. Often perhaps
men dragged into captivity will live better (than
in liberty); and besides, if their captivity be insupportable,
it is in their power to release themselves. If
they remain, it is either because their reason so induces
them&mdash;and then their lot cannot be too hard; or it is
against the dictates of their reason, in which case they
have none but themselves to blame. The wise man,
therefore, will not be unhappy because of the folly of
his own people; he will not allow his lot to depend on
the happiness or misfortunes of other people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1031" id="Page_1031">1031</a></span></p>

<h3>NO MISFORTUNE IS TOO GREAT TO BE CONQUERED
BY VIRTUE.</h3>

<p>8. If the griefs that he himself undergoes are
great, he will support them as well as he can; if they
exceed his power of endurance, they will carry him
off (as thought <span class="locked">Seneca<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span>). In either case, he will not,
in the midst of his sufferings, excite any pity: (ever
master of his reason) he will not allow his own characteristic
light to be extinguished. Thus the flame in
the lighthouse continues to shine, in spite of the raging
of the tempest, in spite of the violent blowing of the
winds. (He should not be upset) even by loss of
consciousness, or even if pain becomes so strong that
its violence could almost annihilate him. If pain become
more intense, he will decide as to what to do;
for, under these circumstances, freedom of will is not
necessarily lost (for suicide remains possible, as
thought <span class="locked">Seneca<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>). Besides, we must realize that these
sufferings do not present themselves to the wise man,
under the same light as to the common man; that all
these need not penetrate to the sanctuary of the man's
life; which indeed happens with the greater part of
pains, griefs and evils that we see being suffered by
others; it would be proof of weakness to be affected
thereby. A no less manifest mark of weakness is to
consider it an advantage to ignore all these evils, and
to esteem ourselves happy that they happen only after
<span class="locked">death,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> without sympathizing with the fate of others,
and thinking only to spare ourselves some grief. This
would be a weakness that we should eliminate in ourselves,
not allowing ourselves to be frightened by the
fear of what might happen. The objection that it is
natural to be afflicted at the misfortunes of those who
surround us, meets the answer that, to begin with, it is
not so with every person; then, that it is part of the
duty of virtue to ameliorate the common condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1032" id="Page_1032">1032</a></span>
human nature, and to raise it to what is more beautiful,
rising above the opinions of the common people. It
is indeed beautiful not to yield to what the common
people usually consider to be evils. We should
struggle against the blows of fortune not by affected
ignoring (of difficulties, like an ostrich), but as a
skilful athlete who knows that the dangers he is incurring
are feared by certain natures, though a nature
such as his bears them easily, seeing in them nothing
terrible, or at least considering them terrifying only
to children. Certainly, the wise man would not have
invited these evils; but on being overtaken by them
he opposes to them the virtue which renders the soul
unshakable and impassible.</p>

<h3>WISDOM IS NONE THE LESS HAPPY FOR BEING
UNCONSCIOUS OF ITSELF.</h3>

<p>9. It may further be objected that the wise man
might lose consciousness, if overwhelmed by disease,
or the malice of magic. Would he still remain happy?
Either he will remain virtuous, being only fallen asleep;
in which case he might continue to be happy, since no
one claims he must lose happiness because of sleep,
inasmuch as no reckoning of the time spent in this
condition is kept, and as he is none the less considered
happy for life. On the other hand, if unconsciousness
be held to terminate virtue, the question at issue is
given up; for, supposing that he continues to be
virtuous, the question at issue was, whether he remain
happy so long as he remains virtuous. It might indeed
still be objected that he cannot be happy if he remain
virtuous without feeling it, without acting in conformity
with virtue. Our answer is that a man would not
be any less handsome or healthy for being so unconsciously.
Likewise, he would not be any less wise
merely for lack of consciousness thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1033" id="Page_1033">1033</a></span></p>

<h3>THOUGH HAPPINESS IS ACTUALIZED WISDOM WE
DO NOT LOSE IT WHEN UNCONSCIOUS. WE DO
NOT LOSE IT BECAUSE WE OURSELVES ARE
ACTUALIZATIONS OF INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>Once more it may be objected that it is essential to
wisdom to be self-conscious, for happiness resides only
in actualized wisdom. This objection would hold if
reason and wisdom were incidentals. But if the hypostatic
substance of wisdom consist in an essence
(being), or rather, in being itself, and if this being do
not perish during sleep, nor during unconsciousness,
if consequently the activity of being continue to subsist
in him; if by its very nature this (being) ceaselessly
watch, then the virtuous man must even in
this state (of sleep or unconsciousness), continue to
exercise his activity. Besides, this activity is ignored
only by one part of himself, and not by himself entirely.
Thus during the operation of the actualization
of <span class="locked">growth,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> the perception of its activity is not by his
sensibility transmitted to the rest of the man. If our
personality were constituted by this actualization of
growth, we would act simultaneously with it; but we
are not this actualization, but that of the intellectual
principle, and that is why we are active simultaneously
with this (divine intellectual activity).</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE IS NOT DEPENDENT ON
CONSCIOUSNESS.</h3>

<p>10. The reason that intelligence remains hidden
is just because it is not felt; only by the means of this
feeling can this activity be felt; but why should intelligence
cease to act (merely because it was not felt)?
On the other hand, why could the soul not have turned
her activity towards intelligence before having felt or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1034" id="Page_1034">1034</a></span>
perceived it? Since (for intelligence) thinking and
existence are identical, perception must have been
preceded by some actualization. It seems impossible
for perception to arise except when thought reflects
upon itself, and when the principle whose activity constitutes
the life of the soul, so to speak, turns backwards,
and reflects, as the image of an object placed
before a brilliant polished mirror reflects itself therein.
Likewise, if the mirror be placed opposite the object,
there is no more image; and if the mirror be withdrawn
or badly adjusted, there is no more image, though the
luminous object continue to act. Likewise, when
that faculty of the soul which represents to us the
images of discursive reason and of intelligence is in a
suitable condition of calm, we get an intuition&mdash;that is,
a somewhat sensual perception thereof&mdash;with the prior
knowledge of the activity of the intelligence, and of
discursive reason. When, however, this image is
troubled by an agitation in the mutual harmony of the
organs, the discursive reason, and the intelligence continue
to act without any image, and the thought does not
reflect in the imagination. Therefore we shall have to
insist that thought is accompanied by an image without,
nevertheless, being one itself. While we are awake,
it often happens to us to perform praiseworthy things,
to meditate and to act, without being conscious of these
operations at the moment that we produce them.
When for instance we read something, we are not
necessarily self-conscious that we are reading, especially
if our attention be fully centered on what we
read. Neither is a brave man who is performing a
courageous deed, self-conscious of his bravery. There
are many other such cases. It would therefore seem
that the consciousness of any deed weakens its energy,
and that when the action is alone (without that consciousness)
it is in a purer, livelier and more vital condition.
When virtuous men are in that condition (of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1035" id="Page_1035">1035</a></span>
absence of self-consciousness), their life is more intense
because it concentrates in itself instead of mingling
with feeling.</p>

<h3>THE ONLY OBJECT OF THE VIRTUOUS WILL IS THE
CONVERSION OF THE SOUL TOWARDS HERSELF.</h3>

<p>11. It has sometimes been said that a man in such
a condition does not really live. (If such be their
honest opinion), they must be told that he does live,
even if they be incapable of understanding his happiness
and his life. If this seem to them incredible,
they should reflect whether their own admission that
such a man lives and is virtuous, does not imply that
under those circumstances he is happy. Neither should
they begin by supposing that he is annihilated, only
later to consider whether he be happy. Neither should
they confine themselves to externalities after having admitted
that he turns his whole attention on things that
he bears within himself; in short, not to believe that
the goal of his will inheres in external objects. Indeed,
such considering of external objects as the goal of the
will of the virtuous man, would be tantamount to a
denial of the very essence (being) of happiness; likewise,
insisting that those are the objects he desires.
His wish would undoubtedly be that all men should
be happy, and that none of them should suffer any
evil; but, nevertheless, he is none the less happy when
that does not happen. Other people, again, would
say that it was unreasonable for the virtuous man to
form such an (impossible) wish, since elimination of
evils here below is out of the <span class="locked">question.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> This, however,
would constitute an admission of our belief that
the only goal of the virtuous man's will is the conversion
of the soul towards herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1036" id="Page_1036">1036</a></span><a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<h3>THE PLEASURES CLAIMED FOR THE VIRTUOUS
MAN ARE OF A HIGHER KIND.</h3>

<p>12. We grant, however, that the pleasures claimed
for the virtuous man are neither those sought by
debauchees, nor those enjoyed by the body. Those
pleasures could not be predicated of him without degrading
his felicity. Nor can we claim for him raptures
of delight&mdash;for what would be their use? It is sufficient
to suppose that the virtuous man tastes the
pleasures attached to the presence of goods, pleasures
which must consist neither in motions, nor be accidental.
He enjoys the presence of those (higher)
goods because he is present to himself; from that time
on he lingers in a state of sweet serenity. The virtuous
man, therefore, is always serene, calm, and satisfied.
If he be really virtuous, his state cannot be troubled
by any of the things that we call evils. Those who
in the virtuous life are seeking for pleasures of another
kind are actually seeking something else than the
virtuous life.</p>

<h3>IN THE VIRTUOUS MAN THE PART THAT SUFFERS
IS THE HIGHER; THEREFORE HE REALLY
DOES NOT SUFFER AS DO THOSE WHO
SUFFER CHIEFLY PHYSICALLY.</h3>

<p>13. The actions of the virtuous man could not be
hindered by fortune, but they may vary with the fluctuations
of fortune. All will be equally beautiful, and,
perhaps, so much the more beautiful as the virtuous
man will find himself placed amidst more critical circumstances.
Any acts that concern contemplation,
which relate to particular things, will be such that the
wise man will be able to produce them, after having
carefully sought and considered what he is to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1037" id="Page_1037">1037</a></span>
Within himself he finds the most infallible of the rules
of conduct, a rule that will never fail him, even were
he within the oft-discussed bull of Phalaris. It is useless
for the vulgar man to repeat, even twice or
<span class="locked">thrice,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> that such a fate is sweet; for if a man were to
utter those words, they are uttered by that very
(animal) part that undergoes those tortures. On the
contrary, in the virtuous man, the part that suffers is
different from that which dwells within itself, and
which, while necessarily residing within itself, is never
deprived of the contemplation of the universal Good.</p>

<h3>MAN BECOMES WISE BY ESTABLISHING A
SPIRITUAL PREPONDERANCE.</h3>

<p>14. Man, and specially the virtuous man, is constituted
not by the composite of soul and <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> as
is proved by the soul's power to separate herself from
the <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> and to scorn what usually are called
"goods." It would be ridiculous to relate happiness
to the animal part of man, since happiness consists in
living well, and living well, being an actualization,
belongs to the soul, exclusively. Not even does it
extend to the entire soul, for happiness does not extend
to that part of the soul concerned with growth, having
nothing in common with the body, neither as to its
size, nor its possible good condition. Nor does it depend
on the perfection of the senses, because their
development, as well as that of the organs, weights
man down, and makes him earthy. Doing good will
be made easier by establishing a sort of counter-weight,
weakening the body, and taming its motions, so as to
show how much the real man differs from the foreign
things that (to speak as do the Stoics), surround him.
However much the (earthy) common man enjoy
beauty, greatness, wealth, command over other men,
and earthly luxuries, he should not be envied for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1038" id="Page_1038">1038</a></span>
deceptive pleasure he takes in all these advantages.
To begin with, the wise man will probably not possess
them; but if he do possess them, he will voluntarily
diminish them, if he take due care of himself. By
voluntary negligence he will weaken and disfigure the
advantages of his body. He will abdicate from dignities.
While preserving the health of his body, he will
not desire to be entirely exempt from disease and
sufferings. If he never experienced these evils, he will
wish to make a trial of them during his youth. But
when he has arrived at old age, he will no longer wish
to be troubled either by pains, or pleasures, or anything
sad or agreeable that relates to the body; so
as not to be forced to give it his attention. He will
oppose the sufferings he will have to undergo with a
firmness that will never forsake him. He will not
believe that his happiness is increased by pleasures,
health or rest, nor destroyed nor diminished by their
contraries. As the former advantages do not augment
his felicity, how could their loss diminish it?</p>

<h3>TWO WISE MEN WILL BE EQUALLY HAPPY, IN SPITE
OF DIFFERENCES OF FORTUNE.</h3>

<p>15. Let us now imagine two wise men, the first
of whom possesses everything that heart can wish for,
while the other is in a contrary position. Shall they be
said to be equally happy? Yes, if they be equally
wise. Even if the one possessed physical beauty, and
all the other advantages that do not relate either to
wisdom, virtue, contemplation of the good, or perfect
life; what would be the use of all that since he who
possesses all these advantages is not considered as
really being happier than he who lacks them? Such
wealth would not even help a flute-player to accomplish
his object! We, however, consider the happy man
only from the standpoint of the weakness of our mind,
considering as serious and frightful what the really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1039" id="Page_1039">1039</a></span>
happy man considers indifferent. For the man could
not be wise, nor consequently happy, so long as he
has not succeeded in getting rid of all these vain ideas,
so long as he has not entirely transformed himself, so
long as he does not within himself contain the confidence
that he is sheltered from all evil. Only then
will he live without being troubled by any fear. The
only thing that should affect him, would be the fear
that he is not an expert in wisdom, that he is only
partly wise. As to unforeseen fears that might get the
better of him before he had had the time to reflect,
during a moment of abstraction of attention, the wise
man will hasten to turn them away, treating that which
within himself becomes agitated as a child that has lost
its way through pain. He will tranquilize it either by
reason, or even by a threat, though uttered without
passion. Thus the mere sight of a worthy person
suffices to calm a child. Besides, the wise man will
not hold aloof either from friendship nor gratitude.
He will treat his own people as he treats himself;
giving to his friends as much as to his own person;
and he will give himself up to friendship, without
ceasing to exercise intelligence therein.</p>

<h3>THE WISE MAN REMAINS UNATTACHED.</h3>

<p>16. If the virtuous man were not located in this
elevated life of intelligence; if on the contrary he were
supposed to be subject to the blows of fate, and if we
feared that they would overtake him, our ideal would
no longer be that of the virtuous man such as we outline
it; we would be considering a vulgar man, mingled
with good and evil, of whom a life equally mingled
with good and evil would be predicated. Even such a
man might not easily be met with, and besides, if we
did meet him, he would not deserve to be called a wise
man; for there would be nothing great about him,
neither the dignity of wisdom, nor the purity of good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1040" id="Page_1040">1040</a></span>
Happiness, therefore, is not located in the life of the
common man. Plato rightly says that you have to
leave the earth to ascend to the good, and that to become
wise and happy, one should turn one's look
towards the only Good, trying to acquire resemblance
to Him, and to live a life conformable to <span class="locked">Him.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> That
indeed must suffice the wise man to reach his goal.
To the remainder he should attach no more value than
to changes of location, none of which can add to his
happiness. If indeed he pay any attention to external
things scattered here and there around him, it is to
satisfy the needs of his body so far as he can. But
as he is something entirely different from the body,
he is never disturbed at having to leave it; and he will
abandon it whenever nature will have indicated the
time. Besides, he always reserves to himself the right
to deliberate about this (time to leave the world by
suicide).<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Achievement of happiness will indeed be
his chief goal; nevertheless, he will also act, not only
in view of his ultimate goal, or himself, but on the
body to which he is united. He will care for this body,
and will sustain it as long as possible. Thus a musician
uses his lyre so long as he can; but as soon as it is
beyond using, he repairs it, or abandons playing the
lyre, because he now can do without it. Leaving it on
the ground, he will look at it almost with scorn, and
will sing without its accompaniment. Nevertheless it
will not have been in vain that this lyre will have been
originally given to him; for he will often have profited
by its use.</p>

<h3>EPICURUS TAUGHT CHANCE AND THE GNOSTICS
AN EVIL CREATOR.</h3>

<p>1. When <span class="locked">Epicurus<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> derives the existence and constitution
of the universe from automatism and chance,
he commits an absurdity, and stultifies himself. That
is self-evident, though the matter have elsewhere been
thoroughly <span class="locked">demonstrated.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> But (if the world do not
owe its origin to chance) we will be compelled to
furnish an adequate reason for the existence and creation
of all these beings. This (teleological) question
deserves the most careful consideration. Things that
seem evil do indeed exist, and they do suggest doubts
about universal Providence; so that some (like <span class="locked">Epicurus<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span>)
insist there is no providence, while others (like
the <span class="locked">Gnostics<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span>), hold that the demiurgic creator is evil.
The subject, therefore, demands thorough investigation
of its first principles.</p>

<h3>PARTICULAR AND UNIVERSAL PROVIDENCE
ASSUMED AS PREMISES.</h3>

<p>Let us leave aside this individual providence, which
consists in deliberating before an action, and in examining
whether we should or should not do something,
or whether we should give or not give it. We
shall also assume the existence of the universal Providence,
and from this principle we shall deduce the
consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1043" id="Page_1043">1043</a></span></p>

<h3>PROVIDENCE IS NOT PARTICULAR BECAUSE THE
WORLD HAD NO BEGINNING.</h3>

<p>We would acknowledge the existence of a particular
Providence, such as we mentioned above, if we thought
that the world had had a beginning of existence, and
had not existed since all eternity. By this particular
Providence we mean a recognition, in the divinity, of
a kind of prevision and reasoning (similar to the
reasoning and prevision of the artist who, before carrying
out a work, deliberates on each of the parts that
compose <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span>). We would suppose that this prevision and
reasoning were necessary to determine how the universe
could have been made, and on what conditions it
should have been the best possible. But as we hold
that the world's existence had no beginning, and that it
has existed since all time, we can, in harmony with
reason and our own views, affirm that universal Providence
consists in this that the universe is conformed
to Intelligence, and that Intelligence is prior to the
universe, not indeed in time&mdash;for the existence of the
Intelligence did not temporarily precede that of the
universe&mdash;but (in the order of things), because, by its
nature, Intelligence precedes the world that proceeds
from it, of which it is the cause, <span class="locked">type<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> and model, and
cause of unchanged perpetual persistence.</p>

<h3>HOW INTELLIGENCE CONTINUES TO MAKE THE
WORLD SUBSIST.</h3>

<p>This is how Intelligence continues to make the world
subsist. Pure Intelligence and Being in itself constitute
the genuine (intelligible) World that is prior to everything,
which has no extension, which is weakened by
no division, which has no imperfection, even in its
parts, for none of its parts are separated from its
totality. This world is the universal Life and Intelligence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1044" id="Page_1044">1044</a></span>
Its unity is both living and intelligent. In it
each part reproduces the whole, its totality consists of a
perfect harmony, because nothing within it is separate,
independent, or isolated from anything else. Consequently,
even if there were mutual opposition, there
would be no struggle. Being everywhere one and
perfect, the intelligible World is permanent and immutable,
for it contains no internal reaction of one
opposite on another. How could such a reaction take
place in this world, since nothing is lacking in it? Why
should Reason produce another Reason within it, and
Intelligence produce another <span class="locked">Intelligence<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> merely because
it was capable of doing so? If so, it would
not, before having produced, have been in a perfect
condition; it would produce and enter in motion because
it contained something <span class="locked">inferior.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> But blissful
beings are satisfied to remain within themselves, persisting
within their essence. A multiple action compromises
him who acts by forcing him to issue from
himself. The intelligible World is so blissful that even
while doing nothing it accomplishes great things, and
while remaining within itself it produces important
operations.</p>

<h3>THE SENSE-WORLD CREATED NOT BY REFLECTION,
BUT BY SELF-NECESSITY.</h3>

<p>2. The sense-world draws its existence from that
intelligible World. The sense-world, however, is not
really unitary; it is indeed multiple, and divided into
a plurality of parts which are separated from each
other, and are mutually foreign. Not love reigns
there, but hate, produced by the separation of things
which their state of imperfection renders mutually
inimical. None of its parts suffices to itself. Preserved
by something else, it is none the less an enemy of the
preserving Power. The sense-world has been created,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1045" id="Page_1045">1045</a></span>
not because the divinity reflected on the necessity of
creating, but because (in the nature of things) it was
unavoidable that there be a nature inferior to the intelligible
World, which, being perfect, could not have
been the last degree of <span class="locked">existence.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> It occupied the
first rank, it had great power, that was universal and
capable of creating without deliberation. If it had had
to deliberate, it would not, by itself, have expressed the
power of creation. It would not have possessed it
essentially. It would have resembled an artisan, who,
himself, does not have the power of creating, but who
acquires it by learning how to work. By giving something
of itself to matter, Intelligence produced everything
without issuing from its rest or quietness. That
which it gives is Reason, because reason is the emanation
of Intelligence, an emanation that is as durable
as the very existence of Intelligence. In a seminal
reason all the parts exist in an united condition, without
any of them struggling with another, without disagreement
or hindrance. This Reason then causes something
of itself to pass into the corporeal mass, where
the parts are separated from each other, and hinder
each other, and destroy each other. Likewise, from this
unitary Intelligence, and from the Reason that proceeds
thence, issues this universe whose parts are separate
and distinct from each other, some of the parts
being friendly and allied, while some are separate and
inimical. They, therefore, destroy each other, either
voluntarily or involuntarily, and through this destruction
their generation is mutually operated. In such a
way did the divinity arrange their actions and experiences
that all concur in the formation of a single <span class="locked">harmony,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span>
in which each utters its individual note because,
in the whole, the Reason that dominates them produces
order and harmony. The sense-world does not enjoy the
perfection of Intelligence and Reason: it only participates
therein. Consequently, the sense-world needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1046" id="Page_1046">1046</a></span>
harmony, because it was formed by the concurrence of
Intelligence and <span class="locked">necessity.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> Necessity drives the
sense-world to evil, and to what is irrational, because
necessity itself is irrational; but Intelligence dominates
necessity. The intelligible World is pure reason; none
other could be such. The world, which is born of it,
had to be inferior to it, and be neither pure reason, nor
mere matter; for order would have been impossible in
unmingled matter. The sense-world, therefore, is a
mixture of matter and Reason; those are the elements
of which it is composed. The principle from which
this mixture proceeds, and which presides over the
mixture, is the Soul. Neither must we imagine that
this presiding over the mixture constitutes an effort
for the Soul; for she easily administers the universe, by
her <span class="locked">presence.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WORLD SHOULD NOT BE BLAMED FOR ITS
IMPERFECTIONS.</h3>

<p>3. For not being beautiful this world should not be
blamed; neither for not being the best of corporeal
worlds; nor should the Cause, from which it derives
its existence, be accused. To begin with, this world
exists necessarily. It is not the work of a reflecting
determination. It exists because a superior Being
naturally begets it in His own likeness. Even if its
creation were the result of reflective determination, it
could not shame its author; for the divinity made the
universe beautiful, complete and harmonious. Between
the greater and lesser parts He introduced a
fortunate accord. A person who would blame the
totality of the world from consideration of its parts
is therefore unjust. He should examine the parts in
their relation to the totality, and see whether they be
in accord and in harmony with it. Then the study
of the whole should continue down to that of the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1047" id="Page_1047">1047</a></span>
details. Otherwise criticism does not apply to the
world as a whole, but only to some of its parts. For
instance, we well know how admirable, as a whole, is
man; yet we grant that there would be justification for
criticism of a separate hair, or toe, or some of the
vilest animals, or Thersites, as a specimen of humanity.</p>

<h3>THE WORLD'S TESTIMONY TO ITS CREATOR.</h3>

<p>Since the work under consideration is the entire
world, we would, were our intelligence attentively to
listen to its voice, hear it exclaim as follows: "It is a
divinity who has made Me, and from the divinity's
hands I issued complete, including all animated beings,
entire and self-sufficient, standing in need of nothing,
since everything is contained within Me; plants,
animals, the whole of Nature, the multitude of the
divinities, the troupe of guardians, excellent souls,
and the men who are happy because of virtue. This
refers not only to the earth, which is rich in plants and
animals of all kinds; the power of the Soul extends also
to the sea. Nor are the air and entire heaven inanimate.
They are the seat of all the excellent Souls,
which communicate life to the stars, and which preside
over the circular revolution of the heaven, a revolution
that is eternal and full of harmony, which imitates the
movement of Intelligence by the eternal and regular
movement of the stars around one and the same
centre, because heaven has no need to seek anything
outside of itself. All the beings I contain aspire to the
Good; all achieve Him, each according to its potentiality.
Indeed, from the Good depends the entire
<span class="locked">heaven,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> my whole Soul, the divinities that inhabit
my various parts, all the animals, all the plants, and
all my apparently inanimate beings. In this aggregation
of beings some seem to participate only in existence,
others in life, others in sensation, others in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1048" id="Page_1048">1048</a></span>
intelligence, while still others seem to participate in all
the powers of life at one <span class="locked">time;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> for we must not expect
equal faculties for unequal things, as for instance sight
for the fingers, as it is suitable to the eye; while the
finger needs something else; it needs its own form,
and has to fulfil its function."</p>

<h3>OPPOSITION AMONG INANIMATE BEINGS.</h3>

<p>4. We should not be surprised at water extinguishing
fire, or at fire destroying some other element.
Even this element was introduced to existence by some
other element, and it is not surprising that it should
be destroyed, since it did not produce itself, and was
introduced to existence only by the destruction of some
other element (as thought Heraclitus and the <span class="locked">Stoics<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span>).
Besides, the extinguished fire is replaced by another
active fire. In the incorporeal heaven, everything is
permanent; in the visible heaven, the totality, as well
as the more important and the most essential parts, are
eternal. The souls, on passing through different
bodies, (by virtue of their <span class="locked">disposition<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span>), themselves
change on assuming some particular form; but, when
they can do so, they stand outside of generation, remaining
united to the universal Soul. The bodies are
alive by their form, and by the whole that each of
them constitutes (by its union with a soul), since they
are animals, and since they nourish themselves; for in
the sense-world life is mobile, but in the intelligible
world it is immobile. Immobility necessarily begat
movement, self-contained life was compelled to produce
other life, and calm being naturally exhaled
vibrating spirit.</p>

<h3>OPPOSITION AMONG ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>Mutual struggle and destruction among animals is
necessary, because they are not born immortal. Their
origin is due to Reason's embracing all of matter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1049" id="Page_1049">1049</a></span>
because this Reason possessed within itself all the
things that subsist in the intelligible World. From
what other source would they have arisen?</p>

<h3>OPPOSITION AMONG HUMANS.</h3>

<p>The mutual wrongs of human beings may however
very easily all be caused by the desire of the Good (as
had been thought by <span class="locked">Democritus<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>). But, having
strayed because of their inability to reach Him, they
turned against each other. They are punished for it
by the degradation these evil actions introduced within
their souls, and, after death, they are driven into a
lower place, for none can escape the Order established
by the Law of the universe (or, the law of <span class="locked">Adrastea<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>).
Order does not, as some would think, exist because of
disorder, nor law on account of lawlessness; in general,
it is not the better that exists on account of the worse.
On the contrary, disorder exists only on account of
order, lawlessness on account of law, irrationality on
account of reason, because order, law and reason,
such as they are here below, are only imitations (or,
borrowings). It is not that the better produced the
worse, but that the things which need participation in
the better are hindered therefrom, either by their
nature, by accident, or by some other obstacle (as
Chrysippus thought that evils happen by consequence
or concomitance). Indeed, that which succeeds only
in acquiring a borrowed order, may easily fail to
achieve it, either because of some fault inherent in its
own nature, or by some foreign obstacle. Things
hinder each other unintentionally, by following different
goals. Animals whose actions are free incline
sometimes towards good, sometimes towards evil (as
the two horses in Plato's Phaedrus).<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Doubtless, they
do not begin by inclining towards evil; but as soon as
there is the least deviation at the origin, the further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1050" id="Page_1050">1050</a></span>
the advance in the wrong road, the greater and more
serious does the divergence become. Besides, the soul
is united to a body, and from this union necessarily
arises appetite. When something impresses us at first
sight, or unexpectedly, and if we do not immediately
repress the motion which is produced within us, we
allow ourselves to be carried away by the object towards
which our inclination drew us. But the punishment
follows the fault, and it is not unjust that the
soul that has contracted some particular nature should
undergo the consequences of her disposition (by passing
into a body which conforms thereto). Happiness
need not be expected for those who have done nothing
to deserve it. The good alone obtain it; and that is
why the divinities enjoy it.</p>

<h3>LACK OF HAPPINESS SHOULD BE BLAMED ON THE
SOUL THAT DOES NOT DESERVE IT.</h3>

<p>5. If then, even here below, souls enjoy the
faculty of arriving at happiness, we should not accuse
the constitution of the universe because some souls
are not happy; the fault rather lies with their weakness,
which hinders them from struggling courageously
enough in the career where prizes are offered to virtue.
Why indeed should we be astonished that the spirits
which have not made themselves divine should not
enjoy divine life? Poverty and diseases are of no importance
to the good, and they are useful to the evil
(as thought Theognis).<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Besides, we are necessarily
subject to diseases, because we have a body. Then
all these accidents are not useless for the order and
existence of the universe. Indeed, when a being is
dissolved into its elements, the Reason of the universe
uses it to beget other beings, for the universal Reason
embraces everything within its sphere of activity. Thus
when the body is disorganized, and the soul is softened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1051" id="Page_1051">1051</a></span>
by her passions, then the body, overcome by sickness,
and the soul, overcome by vice, are introduced into
another series and order. There are things, like
poverty and sickness, which benefit the persons who
undergo them. Even vice contributes to the perfection
of the universe, because it furnishes opportunity for
the exercise of the divine justice. It serves other purposes
also; for instance, it increases the vigilance of
souls, and excites the mind and intelligence to avoid
the paths of perdition; it also emphasizes the value
of virtue by contrast with the evils that overtake the
wicked. Of course, such utilities are not the cause
of the existence of evils; we only mean that, since evils
exist, the divinity made use of them to accomplish His
purposes. It would be the characteristic of a great
power to make even evils promote the fulfilment of its
purposes, to cause formless things to assist in the production
of forms. In short, we assert that evil is only an
omission or failure of good. Now a coming short of
good must necessarily exist in the beings here below,
because in them good is mingled with other things;
for this thing to which the good is allied differs from
the good, and thus produces the lack of good. That is
why "it is impossible for evil to be <span class="locked">destroyed":<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span>
because things are successively inferior, relatively to
the nature of the absolute Good; and because, being
different from the Good from which they derive their
existence, they have become what they are by growing
more distant from their principle.</p>

<h3>IN SPITE OF APPARENT MISFORTUNE TO THE GOOD
NO HARM CAN HAPPEN TO THEM.</h3>

<p>6. It is constantly objected that fortune maltreats
the good, and favors the evil in opposition to the
agreement that ought to exist between virtue and happiness.
The true answer to this is that no harm can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1052" id="Page_1052">1052</a></span>
happen to the righteous man, and no good to the
vicious <span class="locked">man.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> Other objectors ask why one man
is exposed to what is contrary to nature, while the
other obtains what conforms thereto. How can distributive
justice be said to obtain in this world? If,
however, the obtaining of what conforms to nature do
not increase the happiness of the virtuous man, and if
being exposed to what is contrary to nature do not
diminish the wickedness of the vicious man, of what
importance (as thought <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span>), are either of these
conditions? Neither will it matter if the vicious man
be handsome, or the virtuous man ugly.</p>

<h3>THE SLAVERY OF THE GOOD AND VICTORY OF THE
EVIL SEEM TO ACCUSE PROVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>Further objections assert that propriety, order and
justice demand the contrary of the existing state of
affairs in the world, and that we could expect no less
from a Providence that was wise. Even if it were a
matter of moment to virtue or vice, it is unsuitable
that the wicked should be the masters, and chiefs of
state, and that the good should be slaves; for a bad
prince commits the worst crimes. Moreover, the
wicked conquer in battles, and force their prisoners to
undergo the extremities of torments. How could such
facts occur if indeed a divine Providence be in control?
Although indeed in the production of some work (of
art), it be especially the totality that claims attention,
nevertheless, the parts must also obtain their due,
especially when they are animated, living and reasonable;
it is just that divine Providence should extend to
everything, especially inasmuch as its duty is precisely
to neglect nothing. In view of these objections we shall
be forced to demonstrate that really everything here
below is good, if we continue to insist that the sense-world
depends on supreme Intelligence, and that its
power penetrates everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1053" id="Page_1053">1053</a></span></p>

<h3>PERFECTION MUST NOT BE SOUGHT IN THINGS
MINGLED WITH MATTER.</h3>

<p>7. To begin with, we must remark that to show
that all is good in the things mingled with matter (and
therefore of sense), we must not expect to find in
them the whole perfection of the World which is not
soiled by matter, and is intelligible; nor should we expect
to find in that which holds the second rank characteristics
of that which is of the first. Since the world
has a body, we must grant that this body will have
influence on the totality, and expect no more than that
Reason will give it that which this mixed nature was
capable of receiving. For instance, if we were to
contemplate the most beautiful man here below, we
would be wrong in believing that he was identical with
the intelligible Man, and inasmuch as he was made of
flesh, muscles and bones, we would have to be satisfied
with his having received from his creator all the perfection
that could be communicated to him to embellish
these bones, muscles and flesh, and to make
the ("seminal) reason" in him predominate over the
matter within him.</p>

<h3>EVIL IS ONLY A LOWER FORM OF GOOD.</h3>

<p>Granting these premises, we may start out on an
explanation of the above mentioned difficulties. For
in the world we will find remarkable traces of the
Providence and divine Power from which it proceeds.
Let us take first, the actions of souls who do evil voluntarily;
the actions of the wicked who, for instance,
harm virtuous men, or other men equally evil. Providence
need not be held responsible for the wickedness
of these souls. The cause should be sought in the
voluntary determinations of those souls themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1054" id="Page_1054">1054</a></span>
For we have proved that the souls have characteristic
motions, and that while here below they are not pure,
but rather are animals (as would naturally be the case
with souls united to bodies).<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Now, it is not surprising
that, finding themselves in such a condition,
they would live conformably to that <span class="locked">condition.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> Indeed,
it is not the formation of the world that made
them descend here below. Even before the world
existed, they were already disposed to form part of it, to
busy themselves with it, to infuse it with life, to administer
it, and in it to exert their power in a characteristic
manner, either by presiding over its (issues), and
by communicating to it something of their power, or
by descending into it, or by acting in respect to the
world each in its individual <span class="locked">manner.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> The latter question,
however, does not refer to the subject we are
now considering; here it will be sufficient to show that,
however these circumstances occur, Providence is not
to be blamed.</p>

<h3>IT IS A MATTER OF FAITH THAT PROVIDENCE EMBRACES
EVERYTHING HERE BELOW, EVEN THE
MISFORTUNES OF THE JUST.</h3>

<p>But how shall we explain the difference that is observed
between the lot of the good and the evil? How
can it occur that the former are poor, while others are
rich, and possess more than necessary to satisfy their
needs, being even powerful, and governing cities and
nations? (The Gnostics and Manicheans) think that
the sphere of activity of Providence does not extend
down to the <span class="locked">earth.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> No! For all of the rest (of this
world) conforms to (universal) Reason, inasmuch as
animals and plants participate in Reason, Life and Soul.
(The Gnostic) will answer that if Providence do extend
to this earth, it does not predominate therein. As
the world is but a single organism, to advance such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1055" id="Page_1055">1055</a></span>
objection is the part of somebody who would assert
that the head and face of man were produced by
Nature, and that reason dominated therein, while the
other members were formed by other causes, such as
chance or necessity, and that they were evil either on
this account, or because of the importance of Nature.
Wisdom and piety, however, would forbid the admission
that here below not everything was well, blaming
the operation of Providence.</p>

<h3>HOW SENSE-OBJECTS ARE NOT EVIL.</h3>

<p>8. It remains for us to explain how sense-objects
are good and participate in the (cosmic) Order; or at
least, that they are not evil. In every animal, the
higher parts, such as the face and head, are the most
beautiful, and are not equalled by the middle or lower
parts. Now men occupy the middle and lower region
of the universe. In the higher region we find the
heaven containing the divinities; it is they that fill the
greater part of the world, with the vast sphere where
they reside. The earth occupies the centre and seems
to be one of the stars. We are surprised at seeing
injustice reigning here below chiefly because man is
regarded as the most venerable and wisest being in
the universe. Nevertheless, this being that is so wise
occupies but the middle place between divinities and
animals, at different times inclining towards the former
or the latter. Some men resemble the divinities, and
others resemble animals; but the greater part continue
midway between them.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD MAY NEGLECT NATURAL LAWS WHICH
CARRY REWARDS.</h3>

<p>It is those men who occupy this middle place who are
forced to undergo the rapine and violence of depraved
men, who resemble wild beasts. Though the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1056" id="Page_1056">1056</a></span>
are better than those whose violence they suffer, they
are, nevertheless, dominated by them because of inferiority
in other respects, lacking courage, or <span class="locked">preparedness.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span>
It would be no more than a laughing
matter if children who had strengthened their bodies
by exercise, while leaving their souls inviolate in ignorance,
should in physical struggle conquer those of their
companions, who had exercised neither body nor soul;
if they stole their food or soft clothing. No legislator
could hinder the vanquished from bearing the punishment
of their cowardliness and effeminacy, if, neglecting
the gymnastic exercises which had been taught
them, they did not, by their inertia, effeminacy and
laziness, fear becoming fattened sheep fit to be the
prey of wolves? They who commit this rapine and
violence are punished therefor first because they
thereby become wolves and noxious beasts, and later
because (in this or some subsequent existence) they
necessarily undergo the consequences of their evil
actions (as thought <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>). For men who here
below have been evil do not die entirely (when their
soul is separated from their bodies). Now in the
things that are regulated by Nature and Reason, that
which follows is always the result of that which precedes;
evil begets evil, just as good begets good. But
the arena of life differs from a gymnasium, where the
struggles are only games. Therefore, the above-mentioned
children which we divided into two classes,
after having grown up in ignorance, must prepare to
fight, and take up arms, an display more energy than
in the exercises of the gymnasium. As some, however,
are well armed, while the others are not, the first must
inevitably triumph. The divinity must not fight for
the cowardly; for the (cosmic) law decrees that in war
life is saved by valor, and not by <span class="locked">prayers.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> Nor is it
by prayers that the fruits of the earth are obtained;
they are produced only by labor. Nor can one have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1057" id="Page_1057">1057</a></span>
good health without taking care of it. If the evil
cultivate the earth better, we should not complain of
their reaping a better <span class="locked">harvest.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> Besides, in the ordinary
conduct of life, it is ridiculous to listen only to
one's own caprice, doing nothing that is prescribed by
the divinities, limiting oneself exclusively to demanding
one's conservation, without carrying out any of the
actions on which (the divinities) willed that our preservation
should depend.</p>

<h3>DEATH IS BETTER THAN DISHARMONY WITH THE
LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE.</h3>

<p>Indeed it would be better to be dead than to live thus
in contradiction with the laws that rule the universe.
If, when men are in opposition to these laws, divine
Providence preserved peace in the midst of all follies
and vices, it would deserve the charge of negligence in
allowing the prevalence of evil. The evil rule only
because of the cowardice of those who obey them;
this is juster than if it were otherwise.</p>

<h3>PROVIDENCE SHOULD NOT BE EXTENDED TO THE
POINT OF SUPPRESSING OUR OWN INITIATIVE.</h3>

<p>9. Nor should the sphere of Providence be extended
to the point of suppressing our own action. For if
Providence did everything, and Providence alone
existed, it would thereby be annihilated. To what,
indeed, would it apply? There would be nothing but
divinity! It is indeed incontestable that divinity exists,
and that its sphere extends over other beings&mdash;but
divinity does not suppress the latter. For instance,
divinity approaches man, and preserves in him what
constitutes humanity; that is, divinity makes him live
in conformity to the law of Providence, and makes him
fulfil the commandments of that law. Now, this law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1058" id="Page_1058">1058</a></span>
decrees that the life of men who have become virtuous
should be good both here below and after their death;
and that the evil should meet an opposite fate. It
would be unreasonable to expect the existence of men
who forget themselves to come and save the evil,
even if the latter addressed prayers to the divinity.
Neither should we expect the divinities to renounce
their blissful existence to come and administer our affairs;
nor that the virtuous men, whose life is holy
and superior to human conditions, should be willing
to govern the wicked. The latter never busy themselves
with promoting the good to the governing of
other men, and themselves to be good (as thought
<span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span>). They are even jealous of the man who is
good by himself; there would indeed be more good
people if virtuous men were chosen as chiefs.</p>

<h3>THOUGH MEN ARE ONLY MEDIOCRE THEY ARE
NEVER ABANDONED BY PROVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>Man is therefore not the best being in the universe;
according to his choice he occupies an intermediate
rank. In the place he occupies, however, he is not
abandoned by Providence, which ever leads him back
to divine things by the numerous means it possesses
to cause the triumph of virtue. That is the reason why
men have never lost rationality, and why, to some
degree, they always participate in wisdom, intelligence,
art, and the justice that regulates their mutual relations.
Even when one wrongs another, he is still given credit
for acting in justice to himself, and he is treated according
to his <span class="locked">deserts.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> Besides, man, as a creature,
is handsome, as handsome as possible, and, by the part
he plays in the universe, he is superior to all the animals
that dwell here below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1059" id="Page_1059">1059</a></span></p>

<h3>IT IS RIDICULOUS TO COMPLAIN OF THE LOWER
NATURE OF ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>No one in his senses would complain of the existence
of animals inferior to man, if, besides, they contribute
towards the embellishment of the universe.
Would it not be ridiculous to complain that some of
them bite men, as if the latter had an imprescriptible
right to complete security? The existence of these
animals is necessary; it procures us advantages both
evident and still unknown, but which will be revealed
in the course of time. Thus there is nothing useless in
animals, either in respect to themselves, or to <span class="locked">man.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> It
is, besides, ridiculous to complain because many
animals are wild, when there are even men who are
such; what should surprise us most is that many animals
are not submissive to man, and defend themselves
against <span class="locked">him.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span></p>

<h3>IF UNJUST ACTS ARE PRODUCED ASTROLOGICALLY
THEN DIVINE REASON IS TO BLAME.</h3>

<p>10. But if men be evil only in spite of themselves,
and involuntarily, it would be impossible to say that
those who commit injustices, and those who suffer
them are responsible (the former for their ferocity,
and the latter for their <span class="locked">cowardice.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> To this we answer
that if the wickedness of the former (as well as the
cowardice of the latter) be, necessarily, produced by
the course of the stars, or by the action of a principle
of which it is only the effect, then it is explained by
physical reasons. But if it be the very Reason of the
universe that produces such things, how does it not
thereby commit an injustice?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1060" id="Page_1060">1060</a></span></p>

<h3>EVEN INVOLUNTARINESS DOES NOT AFFECT
SPONTANEITY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE.</h3>

<p>Unjust actions are involuntary only in this sense
that one does not have the will to commit a fault; but
this circumstance does not hinder the spontaneity of
the action. However, when one acts spontaneously,
one is responsible for the fault; one would avoid responsibility
for the fault only if one were not the author
of the action. To say that the wicked are such necessarily,
does not mean that they undergo an external
constraint, but that their character is constituted by
wickedness. The influence of the course of the stars
does not destroy our liberty, for, if every action in us
were determined by the exterior influence of such
agents, everything would go on as these agents desired
it; consequently, men would not commit any actions
contrary to the will of these agents. If the divinities
alone were the authors of all our actions, there would
be no impious persons; therefore, impiety is due to
men. It is true that, once the cause is given, the effects
will follow, if only the whole series of causes be given.
But man himself is one of these causes; he therefore
does good by his own nature, and he is a free cause.</p>

<h3>EVEN THE SHADOWS ARE NECESSARY TO THE
PERFECTION OF A PICTURE.</h3>

<p>11. Is it true that all things are produced by necessity,
and by the natural concatenation of causes and
effects, and that, thus, they are as good as possible?
No! It is the Reason which, governing the world,
produces all things (in this sense that it contains all
the "seminal reasons"), and which decrees that they
shall be what they are. It is Reason that, in conformity
with its rational nature, produces what are called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1061" id="Page_1061">1061</a></span>
evils, because it does not wish everything to be equally
good. An artist would not cover the body of a pictured
animal with <span class="locked">eyes.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> Likewise, Reason did not limit
itself to the creation of divinities; it produced beneath
them guardians, then men, then animals, not by envy
(as Plato <span class="locked">remarks<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span>); but because its rational essence
contains an intellectual variety (that is, contains the
"seminal reasons" of all different beings). We resemble
such men as know little of painting, and who would
blame an artist for having put shadows in his picture;
nevertheless, he has only properly disposed the contrasts
of light. Likewise, well-regulated states are not
composed of equal orders. Further, one would not condemn
a tragedy, because it presents personages other
than heroes, such as slaves or peasants who speak
<span class="locked">incorrectly.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> To cut out these inferior personages, and
all the parts in which they appear, would be to injure
the beauty of the <span class="locked">composition.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span></p>

<h3>IT IS REASONABLE FOR THE REASON TO ASSIGN
SOULS TO DIFFERENT RANKS IN THE UNIVERSE.</h3>

<p>12. Since it is the Reason (of the world) which
produced all things by an alliance with matter, and by
preserving its peculiar nature, which is to be composed
of different parts, and to be determined by the principle
from which it proceeds (that is, by Intelligence),
the work produced by Reason under these conditions
could not be improved in beauty. Indeed, the Reason
(of the world) could not be composed of homogeneous
and similar parts; it must, therefore, not be accused,
because it is all things, and because all its parts differ
from others. If it had introduced into the world things
which it had not previously contained, as for instance,
souls, and had forced them to enter into the order of
the world without considering their nature, and if it
had made many become degraded, Reason would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1062" id="Page_1062">1062</a></span>
certainly be to blame. Therefore, we must acknowledge
that the souls are parts of Reason, and that
Reason harmonizes them with the world without
causing their degradation, assigning to each that station
which is suitable to her.</p>

<h3>DIVINE JUSTICE EXTENDS ALSO INTO PAST AND
FUTURE.</h3>

<p>13. There is a further consideration that should not
be overlooked, namely: that if you desire to discover
the exercise of the distributive Justice of the divinity,
it is not sufficient to examine only the present; the
past and future must also be considered. Those who,
in a former life, were slave-owners, if they abused their
power, will be enslaved; and this change would be
useful to them. It impoverishes those who have badly
used their wealth; for poverty is of service even to
virtuous people. Likewise, those who kill will in their
turn be killed; he who commits homicide acts unjustly,
but he who is its victim suffers justly. Thus arises a
harmony between the disposition of the man who is
maltreated, and the disposition of him who maltreats
him as he deserved. It is not by chance that a man
becomes a slave, is made prisoner, or is dishonored.
He (must himself) have committed the violence which
he in turn undergoes. He who kills his mother will
be killed by his son; he who has violated a woman
will in turn become a woman in order to become the
victim of a rape. Hence, the divine <span class="locked">Word<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> called
<span class="locked">Adrastea.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> The orderly system here mentioned really
is "unescapeable," truly a justice and an admirable wisdom.
From the things that we see in the universe we
must conclude that the order which reigns in it is
eternal, that it penetrates everywhere, even in the smallest
thing; and that it reveals an admirable art not only
in the divine things, but also in those that might be supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1063" id="Page_1063">1063</a></span>
to be beneath the notice of Providence, on account
of their minuteness. Consequently, there is an
admirable variety of art in the vilest animal. It extends
even into plants, whose fruits and leaves are so distinguished
by the beauty of form, whose flowers bloom
with so much grace, which grow so easily, and which
offer so much variety. These things were not produced
once for all; they are continually produced with
variety, because the stars in their courses do not always
exert the same influence on things here below. What
is transformed is not transformed and metamorphosed
by chance, but according to the laws of beauty, and
the rules of suitability observed by divine powers.
Every divine Power acts according to its nature, that
is, in conformity with its essence. Now its essence is
to develop justice and beauty in its actualizations; for
if justice and beauty did not exist here, they could
not exist elsewhere.</p>

<h3>THE CREATOR IS SO WISE THAT ALL COMPLAINTS
AMOUNT TO GROTESQUENESS.</h3>

<p>14. The order of the universe conforms to divine
Intelligence without implying that on that account its
author needed to go through the process of reasoning.
Nevertheless, this order is so perfect that he who best
knows how to reason would be astonished to see that
even with reasoning one could not discover a plan wiser
than that discovered as realized in particular natures,
and that this plan better conforms to the laws of
Intelligence than any that could result from reasoning.
It can never, therefore, be proper to find fault with
the Reason that produces all things because of any
(alleged imperfections) of any natural object, nor to
claim, for the beings whose existence has begun, the
perfection of the beings whose existence had no beginning,
and which are eternal, both in the intelligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1064" id="Page_1064">1064</a></span>
World, and in this sense-world. That would amount
to wishing that every being should possess more good
than it can carry, and to consider as insufficient the
form it received. It would, for instance, amount to
complaining, that man does not bear horns, and to
fail to notice that, if Reason had to spread abroad
everywhere, it was still necessary for something great
to contain something less, that in everything there
should be parts, and that these could not equal the
whole without ceasing to be parts. In the intelligible
World every thing is all; but here below each thing is
not all things. The individual man does not have the
same properties as the universal Man. For if the individual
beings had something which was not individual,
then they would be universal. We should not expect
an individual being as such to possess the highest perfection;
for then it would no longer be an individual
being. Doubtless, the beauty of the part is not incompatible
with that of the whole; for the more beautiful
a part is, the more does it embellish the whole. Now
the part becomes more beautiful on becoming similar
to the whole, or imitating its essence, and in conforming
to its order. Thus a ray (of the supreme Intelligence)
descends here below upon man, and shines in
him like a star in the divine sky. To imagine the universe,
one should imagine a colossal <span class="locked">statue<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> that were
perfectly beautiful, animated or formed by the art of
Vulcan, whose ears, face and breast would be adorned
with shimmering stars disposed with marvelous skill.<a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<h3>OBJECTION OF INTERNECINE WAR AMONG
ANIMALS AND MEN.</h3>

<p>15. The above considerations suffice for things
studied each in itself. The mutual relation, however,
between things already begotten, and those that are
still being begotten from time to time, deserves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1065" id="Page_1065">1065</a></span>
attract attention, and may give rise to some objections,
such as the following: How does it happen that animals
devour each other, that men attack each other
mutually, and that they are always in ceaseless internecine
warfare?<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> How could the reason (of the
universe) have constituted such a state of affairs, while
still claiming that all is for the best?</p>

<h3>RESPONSIBILITY CANNOT BE SHIFTED FROM
REASON WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE.</h3>

<p>It does not suffice here to <span class="locked">answer:<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> "Everything is
for the best possible. Matter is the cause that things
are in a state of inferiority; evils could not be destroyed."
It is true enough, indeed, that things had
to be what they are, for they are good. It is not matter
which has come to dominate the universe; it has been
introduced in it so that the universe might be what it
is, or rather, it is caused by reason (?). The principle
of things is, therefore, the Logos, or <span class="locked">Reason<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> (of the
universe), which is everything. By it were things begotten,
by it were they co-ordinated in generation.</p>

<h3>NECESSITY OF INTERNECINE WARFARE.</h3>

<p>What then (will it be objected) is the necessity of
this natural internecine warfare of animals, and also
of men? First, animals have to devour each other in
order to renew themselves; they could not, indeed, last
eternally, even if they were not killed. Is there any
reason to complain because, being already condemned
to death, as they are, they should find an end which is
useful to other beings? What objection can there be
to their mutually devouring each other, in order to
be reborn under other forms? It is as if on the stage
an actor who is thought to be killed, goes to change
his clothing, and returns under another mask. Is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1066" id="Page_1066">1066</a></span>
objected that he was not really dead? Yes indeed,
but dying is no more than a change of bodies, just as
the comedian changes his costume, or if the body were
to be entirely despoiled, this is no more than when an
actor, at the end of a drama, lays aside his costume,
only to take it up again when once more the drama
begins. Therefore, there is nothing frightful in the
mutual transformation of animals into each other. Is
it not better for them to have lived under this condition,
than never to have lived at all? Life would then be
completely absent from the universe, and life could no
longer be communicated to other beings. But as this
universe contains a multiple life, it produces and varies
everything during the course of its existence; as it were
joking with them, it never ceases to beget living beings,
remarkable by beauty and by the proportion of their
forms. The combats in which mortal men continually
fight against each other, with a regularity strongly reminding
of the Pyrrhic dances (as thought <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span>),
clearly show how all these affairs, that are considered so
serious, are only children's games, and that their death
was nothing serious. To die early in wars and battles
is to precede by only a very little time the unescapable
fate of old age, and it is only an earlier departure for
a closer return. We may be comforted for the loss
of our possessions during our lifetime by observing that
they have belonged to others before us, and that, for
those who have deprived us thereof, they form but a
very fragile possession, since they, in turn, will be
bereft thereof by others; and that, if they be not despoiled
of their riches, they will lose still more by keeping
<span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> Murders, massacres, the taking and pillaging
of towns should be considered as in the theatre we
consider changes of scene and of personages, the tears
and cries of the actors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1067" id="Page_1067">1067</a></span><a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<h3>ALL THESE CHANGES OF FORTUNE AFFECT ONLY
THE OUTER MAN IN ANY CASE.</h3>

<p>In this world, indeed, just as in the theatre, it is not
the soul, the interior man, but his shadow, the exterior
man, who gives himself up to lamentations and groans,
who on this earth moves about so much, and who
makes of it the scene of an immense drama with numberless
different acts (?) Such is the characteristic of
the actions of a man who considers exclusively the
things placed at his feet, and outside of him, and who
does not know that his tears and serious occupations
are any more than <span class="locked">games.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span> The really earnest man
occupies himself seriously only with really serious affairs,
while the frivolous man applies himself to frivolous
things. Indeed, frivolous things become serious
for him who does not know really serious occupations,
and who himself is frivolous. If, indeed, one cannot
help being mixed up in this child's play, it is just as well
to know that he has fallen into child's play where one's
real personality is not in question. If Socrates were to
mingle in these games, it would only be his exterior
man who would do so. Let us add that tears and
groans do not prove that the evils we are complaining
of are very real evils; for often children weep and
lament over imaginary grievances.</p>

<h3>DOES THIS POINT OF VIEW DESTROY SIN AND
JUSTICE?</h3>

<p>16. If the above considerations be true, what about
wickedness, injustice, and sin? For if everything be
well, how can there be agents who are unjust, and who
sin? If no one be unjust, or sinful, how can unhappy
men exist? How can we say that certain things conform
to nature, while others are contrary thereto, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1068" id="Page_1068">1068</a></span>
everything that is begotten, or that occurs, conforms
to nature? Last, would that point of view not do away
entirely with impiety towards the divinity, if it be the
divinity that makes things such as they are, if the
divinity resemble a poet, who would in his drama introduce
a character whose business it was to ridicule
and criticize the author?</p>

<h3>THIS PROBLEM SOLVED BY REASON BEING
DERIVED FROM INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>Let us, therefore, more clearly define the Reason
(of the universe), and let us demonstrate that it should
be what it is. To reach our conclusion more quickly,
let us grant the existence of this Reason. This Reason
(of the universe) is not pure, absolute Intelligence.
Neither is it the pure Soul, but it depends therefrom.
It is a ray of light that springs both from Intelligence
and from the Soul united to Intelligence. These two
principles beget Reason, that is, a rational quiet <span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span>
Now all life is an actualization, even that which occupies
the lowest rank. But the actualization (which
constitutes the life of Reason) is not similar to the
actualization of fire. The actualization of the life
(peculiar to Reason), even without feeling, is not a
blind movement. All things that enjoy the presence
of Reason, and which participate therein in any manner
soever, immediately receive a rational disposition,
that is, a form; for the actualization which constitutes
the life (of the Reason) can impart its forms, and for
that actualization motion is to form beings. Its movement,
like that of a dancer, is, therefore, full of art.
A dancer, indeed, gives us the image of that life full
of art; it is the art that moves it, because the art itself
is its life. All this is said to explain the nature of life,
whatever it be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1069" id="Page_1069">1069</a></span></p>

<h3>THE UNITY OF REASON IS CONSTITUTED BY THE
CONTRARIES IT CONTAINS.</h3>

<p>As reason proceeds from Intelligence and Life, which
possesses both fulness and unity, Reason does not possess
the unity and fulness of Intelligence and Life.
Consequently, Reason does not communicate the
totality and universality of its essence to the beings to
which it imparts itself. It, therefore, opposes its parts
to each other, and creates them defective; whereby,
Reason constitutes and begets war and struggle. Thus
Reason is the universal unity, because it could not be
the absolute unity. Though reason imply struggle,
because it consists of parts, it also implies unity and
harmony. It resembles the reason of a drama, whose
unity contains many diversities. In a drama, however,
the harmony of the whole results from its component
contraries being co-ordinated in the unity of action,
while, in universal Reason, it is from unity that the
struggle of contraries arises. That is why we may
well compare universal Reason to the harmony formed
by contrary sounds, and to examine why the reasons
of the beings also contain contraries. In a concert,
these reasons produce low and high sounds, and, by
virtue of the harmony, that constitutes their essence,
they make these divers sounds contribute to unity, that
is, to <span class="locked">Harmony<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> itself, the supreme Reason of which
they are only <span class="locked">parts.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> In the same way we must consider
other oppositions in the universe, such as black
and white, heat and cold, winged or walking animals,
and reasonable and irrational beings. All these things
are parts of the single universal Organism. Now if
the parts of the universal Organism were often in
mutual disagreement, the universal Organism, nevertheless,
remains in perfect accord with itself because
it is universal, and it is universal by the Reason that
inheres in it. The unity of this Reason must therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1070" id="Page_1070">1070</a></span>
be composed of opposite reasons, because their very
opposition somehow constitutes its essence. If the
Reason (of the world) were not multiple, it would no
longer be universal, and would not even exist any
longer. Since it exists, Reason must, therefore, contain
within itself some difference; and the greatest difference
is opposition. Now if Reason contain a difference,
and produce different things, the difference that
exists in these things is greater than that which exists
in Reason. Now difference carried to the highest degree
is opposition. Therefore, to be perfect, Reason
must from its very essence produce things not only
different, but even opposed.</p>

<h3>THE WHOLE IS GOOD THOUGH COMPOSED OF
GOOD AND EVIL PARTS.</h3>

<p>17. If Reason thus from its essence produce opposed
things, the things it will produce will be so much
the more opposed as they are more separated from
each other. The sense-world is less unitary than its
Reason, and consequently, it is more manifold, containing
more oppositions. Thus, in individuals, the
love of life has greater force; selfishness is more powerful
in them; and often, by their avidity, they destroy
what they love, when they love what is perishable. The
love which each individual has for himself, makes him
appropriate all he can in his relations with the universe.
Thus the good and evil are led to do opposite things
by the Art that governs the universe; just as a choric
ballet would be directed. One part is good, the other
poor; but the whole is good. It might be objected
that in this case no evil person will be left. Still,
nothing hinders the existence of the evil; only they
will not be such as they would be taken by themselves.
Besides, this will be a motive of leniency in regard to
them, unless Reason should decide that this leniency
be not deserved, thereby making it impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1071" id="Page_1071">1071</a></span><a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<h3>FOUNDED ON THE PUN ON LOGOS, AS CHARACTER,
ROLE AND REASON, THE EVILS ARE SHOWN TO
PLAY THEIR PART BADLY IN THE DRAMA OF
LIFE.</h3>

<p>Besides, if this world contain both bad and good
people, and if the latter play the greater part in the
world, there will take place that which is seen in
dramas where the poet, at times, imposes his ideas
on the actors, and again at others relies on their ingenuity.
The obtaining of the first, second or third
rank by an actor does not depend on the poet. The
poet only assigns to each the part he is capable of
filling, and assigns to him a suitable place. Likewise
(in the world), each one occupies his assigned place,
and the bad man, as well as the good one, has the
place that suits him. Each one, according to his
nature and character, comes to occupy the place that
suits him, and that he had chosen, and then speaks and
acts with piety if he be good, and impiously, if he be
evil. Before the beginning of the drama, the actors
already had their proper characters; they only developed
it. In dramas composed by men, it is the
poet who assigns their parts to the actors; and the
latter are responsible only for the efficiency or inefficiency
of their acting; for they have nothing to do
but repeat the words of the poet. But in this drama
(of life), of which men imitate certain parts when
their nature is poetic, it is the soul that is the actor.
This actor receives his part from the creator, as stage-actors
receive from the poet their masks, garments,
their purple robe, or their rags. Thus in the drama
of the world it is not from chance that the soul receives
her part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1072" id="Page_1072">1072</a></span></p>

<h3>LIKE GOOD AND BAD ACTORS, SOULS ARE PUNISHED
AND REWARDED BY THE MANAGER.</h3>

<p>Indeed, the fate of a soul conforms to her character,
and, by going through with her part properly, the soul
fulfils her part in the drama managed by universal
Reason. The soul sings her part, that is, she does that
which is in her nature to do. If her voice and features
be beautiful, by themselves, they lend charm to the
poem, as would be natural. Otherwise they introduce
a displeasing element, but which does not alter the
nature of the <span class="locked">work.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> The author of the drama reprimands
the bad actor as the latter may deserve it, and
thus fulfils the part of a good judge. He increases the
dignity of the good actor, and, if possible, invites him
to play beautiful pieces, while he relegates the bad
actor to inferior pieces. Likewise, the soul which takes
part in the drama of which the world is the theatre,
and which has undertaken a part in it, brings with her
a disposition to play well or badly. At her arrival she
is classed with the other actors, and after having been
allotted to all the various gifts of fortune without any
regard for her personality or activities, she is later
punished or rewarded. Such actors have something
beyond usual actors; they appear on a greater scene;
the creator of the universe gives them some of his
power, and grants them the freedom to choose between
a great number of places. The punishments and
rewards are so determined that the souls themselves
run to meet them, because each soul occupies a place
in conformity with her character, and is thus in harmony
with the Reason of the <span class="locked">universe.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SOUL MUST FIT HERSELF TO HER SPECIAL
PART IN THE GREAT SCHEME.</h3>

<p>Every individual, therefore, occupies, according to
justice, the place he deserves, just as each string of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1073" id="Page_1073">1073</a></span>
the lyre is fixed to the place assigned to it by the nature
of the sounds it is to render. In the universe everything
is good and beautiful if every being occupy the
place he deserves, if, for instance, he utter discordant
sounds when in darkness and Tartarus; for such sounds
fit that place. If the universe is to be beautiful, the
individual must not behave "like a stone" in it; he
must contribute to the unity of the universal harmony
by uttering the sound suitable to him (as thought
<span class="locked">Epictetus<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span>). The sound that the individual utters
is the life he leads, a life which is inferior in greatness,
goodness and power (to that of the universe). The
shepherd's pipe utters several sounds, and the weakest
of them, nevertheless, contributes to the total Harmony,
because this harmony is composed of unequal
sounds whose totality constitutes a perfect harmony.
Likewise, universal Reason though one, contains unequal
parts. Consequently, the universe contains different
places, some better, and some worse, and their
inequality corresponds to the inequality of the soul.
Indeed, as both places and souls are different, the souls
that are different find the places that are unequal, like
the unequal parts of the pipe, or any other musical
instrument. They inhabit different places, and each
utters sounds proper to the place where they are, and
to the universe. Thus what is bad for the individual
may be good for the totality; what is against nature
in the individual agrees with the nature in the whole.
A sound that is feeble does not change the harmony
of the universe, as&mdash;to use another example&mdash;one bad
citizen does not change the nature of a well-regulated
city; for often there is need of such a man in a city;
he therefore fits it well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1074" id="Page_1074">1074</a></span></p>

<h3>UNIVERSAL REASON TRIES TO PATCH UP "GAGS"
BY UNDISCIPLINED ACTORS.</h3>

<p>18. The difference that exists between souls in
respect to vice and virtue has several causes; among
others, the inequality that exists between souls from
the very beginning. This inequality conforms to the
essence of universal Reason, of which they are unequal
parts, because they differ from each other. We must
indeed remember that souls have three ranks (the
intellectual, rational, and sense lives), and that the
same soul does not always exercise the same faculties.
But, to explain our meaning, let us return to our former
illustration. Let us imagine actors who utter words
not written by the poet; as if the drama were incomplete,
they themselves supply what is lacking, and fill
omissions made by the poet. They seem less like
actors than like parts of the poet, who foresaw what
they were to say, so as to reattach the remainder so
far as it was in his <span class="locked">power.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span> In the universe, indeed,
all things that are the consequences and results of bad
deeds are produced by reasons, and conform to the
universal Reason. Thus, from an illicit union, or from
a rape, may be born natural children that may become
very distinguished men; likewise, from cities destroyed
by perverse individuals, may rise other flourishing
cities.</p>

<h3>THIS ILLUSTRATION OF DRAMA ALLOWS BOTH
GOOD AND EVIL TO BE ASCRIBED TO REASON.</h3>

<p>It might indeed be objected that it is absurd to introduce
into the world souls some of which do good, and
others evil; for when we absolve universal Reason from
the responsibility of evil, we are also simultaneously
taking from it the merit for the good. What, however,
hinders us from considering deeds done by actors as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1075" id="Page_1075">1075</a></span>
parts of a drama, in the universe as well as on the
stage, and thus to derive from universal Reason both
the good and the evil that are done here below? For
universal Reason exercises its influence on each of the
actors with so much the greater force as the drama
is more perfect, and as everything depends on <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span></p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO THE NEXT BOOK.</h3>

<p>But why should we at all impute evil deeds to universal
Reason? The souls contained in the universe
will not be any more divine for that. They will still
remain parts of the universal Reason (and consequently,
remain souls): for we shall have to acknowledge
that all reasons are souls. Otherwise if the
Reason of the universe be a Soul, why should certain
"reasons" be souls, and others only ("seminal)
reasons"?</p>

<h3>SOULS SHOW KINSHIP TO WORLD-SOUL BY
FIDELITY TO THEIR OWN NATURE.</h3>

<p>1. The question (why some reasons are souls,
while others are reasons merely, when at the same
time universal Reason is a certain Soul), may be
answered as follows. Universal Reason (which proceeds
from the universal Soul) embraces both good
and bad things, which equally belong to its parts; it
does not engender them, but exists with them in its
universality. In fact, these "logoses" (or reasons)
(or, particular souls), are the acts of the universal
Soul; and these reasons being parts (of the universal
Soul) have parts (of the operations) as their acts (or
energies). Therefore, just as the universal Soul,
which is one, has different parts, so this difference
occurs again in the reasons and in the operations
they effect. Just as their works (harmonize), so do
the souls themselves mutually harmonize; they harmonize
in this, that their very diversity, or even opposition,
forms an unity. By a natural necessity does
everything proceed from, and return to unity; thus
creatures which are different, or even opposed, are not
any the less co-ordinated in the same system, and that
because they proceed from the same principle. Thus
horses or human beings are subsumed under the unity
of the animal species, even though animals of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1078" id="Page_1078">1078</a></span>
kind, such as horses, for example, bite each other, and
struggle against each other with a jealousy which rises
to fury; and though animals of either species, including
man, do as much. Likewise, with inanimate
things; they form divers species, and should likewise
be subsumed under the genus of inanimate things; and,
if you go further, to essence, and further still, to super-Essence
(the One). Having thus related or subsumed
everything to this principle, let us again descend, by
dividing it. We shall see unity splitting, as it penetrates
and embraces everything simultaneously in a unique
(or all-embracing system). Thus divided, the unity
constitutes a multiple organism; each of its constituent
parts acts according to its nature, without ceasing to
form part of the universal Being; thus is it that the
fire burns, the horse behaves as a horse should, and
men perform deeds as various as their characters. In
short, every being acts, lives well or badly, according
to its own nature.</p>

<h3>APPARENT CHANCE REALLY IS THE PLAN OF A
DIVINE GENERAL PROVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>2. Circumstances, therefore, are not decisive of
human fortune; they themselves only derive naturally
from superior principles, and result from the mutual
concatenation of all things. This concatenation, however,
derives from the (Stoic) "predominant (element
in the universe"), and every being contributes to it
according to its nature; just as, in an army, the general
commands, and the soldiers carry out his orders cooperatively.
In the universe, in fact, everything has
been strategically ordered by Providence, like a general,
who considers everything, both actions and <span class="locked">experiences,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span>
victuals and drink, weapons and implements,
arranging everything so that every detail finds
its suitable location. Thus nothing happens which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1079" id="Page_1079">1079</a></span>
fails to enter into the general's plan, although his opponents'
doings remain foreign to his influence, and
though he cannot command their army. If indeed,
Providence <span class="locked">were<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> "the great Chief over all," to whom
the universe is subordinated, what could have disarranged
His plans, and could have failed to be intimately
associated therewith?</p>

<h3>WE CANNOT QUESTION OUR ORDER IN THE
HIERARCHY OF NATURE.</h3>

<p>3. Although I am able to make any desired decision,
nevertheless my decision enters into the plan
of the universe, because my nature has not been introduced
into this plan subsequently; but it includes me
and my character. But whence originates my character?
This includes two points: is the cause of any man's
character to be located in Him who formed him, or in
that man himself? Must we, on the other hand, give
up seeking its cause? Surely: just as it is hopeless to
ask why plants have no sensation, or why animals are
not men; it would be the same as asking why men are
not gods. Why should we complain that men do not
have a more perfect nature, if in the case of plants and
animals nobody questions or accuses either these
beings themselves, nor the power which has made
them? (This would be senseless, for two reasons):
if we say that they might have been better, we are
either speaking of the qualities which each of them is
capable of acquiring by himself; and in this case we
should blame only him who has not acquired them&mdash;or,
we are speaking of those qualities which he should
derive not from himself, but from the Creator, in
which case it would be as absurd to claim for man more
qualities than he has received, than it would be to do
so in the case of plants or animals. What we should
examine is not if one being be inferior to another, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1080" id="Page_1080">1080</a></span>
if it be complete within its own sphere; for evidently
natural inequalities are unavoidable. This again depends
on conformity to nature, not that inequalities
depend on the will of the principle which has regulated
all things.</p>

<h3>THE CAUSE OF OUR IMPERFECTIONS IS DISTANCE
FROM THE SUPREME.</h3>

<p>The Reason of the Universe, indeed, proceeds from
the universal Soul; and the latter, in turn, proceeds
from Intelligence. Intelligence, however, is not a particular
being; it consists of all (intelligible beings),<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
and all the beings form a plurality. Now, a plurality
of being implies mutual differences between them, consisting
of first, second and third ranks. Consequently,
the souls of engendered animals are rather degradations
of souls, seeming to have grown weaker by their procession.
The (generating) reason of the animal, indeed,
although it be animated, is a soul other than that
from which proceeds universal Reason. This Reason
itself loses excellence in the degree that it hastens down
to enter into matter, and what it produces is less perfect.
Nevertheless, we may well consider how admirable
a work is the creature, although it be so far
distant from the creator. We should, therefore, not
attribute to the creator the (imperfections of the)
creature; for any principle is superior to its product.
So we may assert that (the principle even of imperfect
things) is perfect; and, (instead of complaining), we
should rather admire His communication of some traits
of His power to beings dependent from Him. We have
even reason to be more than grateful for His having
given gifts greater than they can receive or assimilate;
and as the gifts of Providence are superabundant, we
can find the cause (of imperfection) only in the
creatures themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1081" id="Page_1081">1081</a></span></p>

<h3>DOUBLENESS OF SOUL, REASONS AND PROVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>4. If man were simple&mdash;that is, if he were no more
than what he had been created, and if all his actions and
passions derived from the same principle&mdash;we would
no more exercise our reason to complain for his behoof
than we have to complain for that of other animals.
But we do have something to blame in the man, and
that in the perverted man. We have good grounds
for this blame, because man is not only that which he
was created, but has, besides, another principle which
is free (intelligence, with reason). This free principle,
however, is not outside of Providence, and the Reason
of the universe, any more than it would be reasonable
to suppose that the things above depended on the
things here below. On the contrary, it is superior
things which shed their radiance on inferior ones, and
this is the cause of the perfection of Providence. As
to the Reason of the universe, it itself is double also;
one produces things, while the other unites generated
things to intelligible ones. Thus are constituted two
providences: a superior one, from above (intellectual
Reason, the principal power of the <span class="locked">soul<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span>), and an
inferior one, the (natural and generative power, called)
reason, which derives from the first; and from both
results the concatenation of things, and universal Providence
(or, Providence, and destiny).</p>

<h3>MEN'S BETTER NATURE IS NOT DOMINANT BECAUSE
OF THEIR SUB-CONSCIOUS NATURE.</h3>

<p>Men (therefore, not being only what they were
made) possess another principle (free intelligence with
reason); but not all make use of all the principles they
possess; some make use of the one principle (their
intelligence), while others make use of the other
(principle of reason), or even of the lower principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1082" id="Page_1082">1082</a></span>
(of imagination and sensation).<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> All these principles
are present in the man, even when they do not react on
him; and even in this case, they are not inert; each
fulfils its peculiar office; only they do not all act
simultaneously upon him (or, are not perceived by
his consciousness). It may seem difficult to understand
how this may be the case with all of them present,
and it might seem easier to consider them absent;
but they are present in us, in the sense that we lack
none of them; although we might consider them absent
in the sense that a principle that does not react on
a man might be considered absent from him. It might
be asked why these principles do not react on all men,
since they are part of them? We might, referring
chiefly to this (free, intelligent, reasonable) principle,
say that first, it does not belong to animals; second,
it is not even (practiced) by all men. If it be not
present in all men, so much the more is it not alone
in them, because the being in whom this principle alone
is present lives according to this principle, and lives
according to other principles only so far as he is compelled
by necessity. The cause (which hinders intelligence
and reason from dominating us) will have to
be sought in the (Stoic) substrate of the man, either
because our corporeal constitution troubles the superior
principle (of reason and intelligence), or because of
the predominance of our passions.</p>

<p>(After all), we have not yet reached any conclusion,
because this substrate of man is composed of two elements:
the ("seminal) <span class="locked">reason,"<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> and matter; (and
either of them might be the cause). At first blush, it
would seem that the cause (of the predominance of our
lower natures) must be sought in matter, rather than
in the ("seminal) reason"; and that which dominates
in us is not ("seminal) reason," but matter and organized
substrate. This, however, is not the case. What
plays the part of substrate in respect of the superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1083" id="Page_1083">1083</a></span>
principle (of free intelligence and reason), is both
the ("seminal) reason," and that which is generated
thereby, conforming to that reason; consequently, the
predominant element in us is not matter, any more
than our corporeal constitution.</p>

<h3>HUMAN CHARACTER MAY BE RESULT OF FORMER
LIVES.</h3>

<p>Besides, our individual characters might be derived
from pre-existences. In this case we would say that
our ("seminal) reason" has degenerated as a result
of our antecedents, that our soul has lost her force by
irradiating what was below her. Besides, our ("seminal)
reason" contains within itself the very reason
of our constituent matter, a matter which it discovered,
or conformed to its own <span class="locked">nature.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> In fact, the ("seminal)
reason" of an ox resides in no matter other than
that of an ox. Thus, as said (Plato<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>), the soul finds
herself destined to pass into the bodies of animals
other than men, because, just like the ("seminal)
reason," she has altered, and has become such as to
animate an ox, instead of a man. By this decree of
divine justice she becomes still worse than she was.</p>

<h3>CAUSES OF DETERIORATION.</h3>

<p>But why did the soul ever lose her way, or deteriorate?
We have often said that not all souls belong to
the first rank; some belong to a second, or even third
rank, and who, consequently, are inferior to those of
the first. Further, leaving the right road may be
caused by a trifling divergence. Third, the approximation
of two differing things produces a combination
which may be considered a third somewhat, different
from the other two components. (Thus even in this
new element, or "habituation") the being does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1084" id="Page_1084">1084</a></span>
lose the qualities he received with his existence; if he
be inferior, he has been created inferior from the very
origin; it is what he was created, he is inferior by the
very virtue of his nature; if he suffer the consequences
thereof, he suffers them justly. Fourth, we must
allow for our anterior existence, because everything
that happens to us to-day results from our antecedents.</p>

<h3>THIS PROVIDENCE IS THE NORMATIVE, CURATIVE,
SANATIVE ELEMENT OF LIFE.</h3>

<p>5. From first to last Providence descends from on
high, communicating its gifts not according to the
law of an equality that would be numeric, but proportionate,
varying its operations according to locality
(or occasion). So, in the organization of an animal,
from beginning to end, everything is related; every
member has its peculiar function, superior or inferior,
according to the rank it occupies; it has also its
peculiar passions, passions which are in harmony with
its nature, and the place it occupies in the system of
things. So, for instance, a blow excites responses that
differ according to the organ that received it; the vocal
organ will produce a sound; another organ will suffer
in silence, or execute a movement resultant from that
passion; now, all sounds, actions and passions form in
the animal the unity of sound, life and <span class="locked">existence.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span>
The parts, being various, play different roles; thus
there are differing functions for the feet, the eyes,
discursive reason, and intelligence. But all things
form one unity, relating to a single Providence, so that
destiny governs what is below, and providence reigns
alone in what is on high. In fact, all that lies in the
intelligible world is either rational or super-rational,
namely: Intelligence and pure Soul. What derives
therefrom constitutes Providence, as far as it derives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1085" id="Page_1085">1085</a></span>
therefrom, as it is in pure Soul, and thence passes into
the animals. Thence arises (universal) Reason, which,
being distributed in unequal parts, produces things unequal,
such as the members of an animal. As consequences
from Providence are derived the human deeds
which are agreeable to the divinity. All such actions
are related (to the plan of Providence); they are not
done by Providence; but when a man, or another
animate or inanimate being performs some deeds,
these, if there be any good in them, enter into the
plan of Providence, which everywhere establishes
virtue, and amends or corrects errors. Thus does
every animal maintain its bodily health by the kind of
providence within him; on the occasion of a cut or
wound the ("seminal) reason" which administers the
body of this animal immediately draws (the tissues)
together, and forms scars over the flesh, re-establishes
health, and invigorates the members that have suffered.</p>

<h3>THE PLANS OF PROVIDENCE LIKENED TO THE
FOREKNOWLEDGE OF A PHYSICIAN.</h3>

<p>Consequently, our evils are the consequences (of
our actions); they are its necessary effects, not that
we are carried away by Providence, but in the sense
that we obey an impulsion whose principle is in ourselves.
We ourselves then indeed try to reattach our
acts to the plan of Providence, but we cannot conform
their consequences to its will; our acts, therefore,
conform either to our will, or to other things in the
universe, which, acting on us, do not produce in us an
affection conformed to the intentions of Providence.
In fact, the same cause does not act identically on
different beings, for the effects experienced by each
differ according to their nature. Thus Helena causes
emotions in Paris which differ from those of <span class="locked">Idumeneus.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span>
Likewise, the handsome man produces on a
handsome man an effect different from that of the intemperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1086" id="Page_1086">1086</a></span>
man on the intemperate; the handsome and
temperate man acts differently on the handsome and
temperate man than on the intemperate; and than the
intemperate on himself. The deed done by the intemperate
man is done neither by Providence, nor
according to <span class="locked">Providence.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> Neither is the deed done
by the temperate man done by Providence; since he
does it himself; but it conforms to Providence, because
it conforms to the Reason (of the universe). Thus,
when a man has done something good for his health,
it is he himself who has done it, but he thereby conforms
to the reason of the physician; for it is the
physician who teaches him, by means of his art, what
things are healthy or unhealthy; but when a man has
done something injurious to his health, it is he himself
who has done it, and he does it against the providence
of the physician.</p>

<h3>PREDICTION DOES NOT WORK BY PROVIDENCE,
BUT BY ANALOGY.</h3>

<p>6. If then (the bad things do not conform to
Providence), the diviners and astrologers predict evil
things only by the concatenation which occurs between
contraries, between form and matter, for instance,
in a composite being. Thus in contemplating
the form and ("seminal) reason" one is really contemplating
the being which receives the form; for one
does not contemplate in the same way the intelligible
animal, and the composite animal; what one contemplates
in the composite animal is the ("seminal)
reason" which gives form to what is inferior. Therefore,
since the world is an animal, when one contemplates
its occurrences, one is really contemplating the
causes that make them arise, the Providence which
presides over them, and whose action extends in an
orderly manner to all beings and events; that is, to all
animals, their actions and dispositions, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1087" id="Page_1087">1087</a></span>
dominated by Reason and mingled with necessity. We
thus contemplate what has been mingled since the beginning,
and what is still continually mingled. In this
mixture, consequently, it is impossible to distinguish
Providence from what conforms thereto, nor what derives
from the substrate (that is, from matter, and
which, consequently, is deformed, and evil). This is
not a human task, not even of a man who might be
wise or divine; such a privilege can be ascribed only to
God.</p>

<h3>FACTS OF LIFE ARE LETTERS THAT CAN BE READ.</h3>

<p>In fact, the function of the diviner is not to distinguish
the cause, but the fact; his art consists in
reading the characters traced by nature, and which invariably
indicate the order and concatenation of facts;
or rather, in studying the signs of the universal movement,
which designate the character of each being
before its revelation in himself. All beings, in fact,
exercise upon each other a reciprocal influence, and
concur together in the constitution and perpetuity of
the <span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span> To him who studies, analogy reveals the
march of events, because all kinds of divination are
founded on its laws; for things were not to depend on
each other, but to have relations founded on their <span class="locked">resemblance.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span>
This no doubt is that <span class="locked">which<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> is meant
by the expression that "analogy embraces everything."</p>

<h3>ANALOGY DEMANDED BY THE UNITY OF GOD.</h3>

<p>Now, what is this analogy? It is a relation between
the worse and the worse, the better and the better, one
eye and the other, one foot and the other, virtue and
justice, vice and injustice. The analogy which reigns
in the universe is then that which makes divination
possible. The influence which one being exercises on
another conforms to the laws of influence which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1088" id="Page_1088">1088</a></span>
members of the universal Organism must exercise upon
each other. The one does not produce the other; for
all are generated together; but each is affected according
to its nature, each in its own manner. This constitutes
the unity of the Reason of the universe.</p>

<h3>EVIL IS INSEPARABLE FROM THE GOOD.</h3>

<p>7. It is only because there are good things in the
world, that there are worse ones. Granting the conception
of variety, how could the worse exist without
the better, or the better without the worse? We
should not, therefore, accuse the better because of the
existence of the worse; but rather we should rejoice in
the presence of the better, because it communicates a
little of its perfection to the worse. To wish to annihilate
the worse in the world is tantamount to annihilating
Providence <span class="locked">itself;<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> for if we annihilate the
worse, to what could Providence be applied? Neither
to itself, nor to the better; for when we speak of
supreme Providence, we call it supreme in contrast
with that which is inferior to it.</p>

<h3>THE PARABLE OF THE VINE AND THE BRANCHES.</h3>

<p>Indeed, the (supreme) Principle is that to which
all other things relate, that in which they all simultaneously
exist, thus constituting the totality. All things
proceed from the Principle, while it remains wrapt in
itself. Thus, from a single root, which remains wrapt
in itself, issue a host of parts, each of which offers the
image of their root under a different form. Some of
them touch the root; others trend away from it, dividing
and subdividing down to the branches, twigs,
leaves and fruits; some abide permanently (like the
branches); others swirl in a perpetual flux, like the
leaves and fruits. These latter parts which swirl in a
perpetual flux contain within themselves the ("seminal)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1089" id="Page_1089">1089</a></span>
reasons" of the parts from which they proceed
(and which abide permanently); they themselves seem
disposed to be little miniature trees; if they engendered
before perishing, they would engender only that which
is nearest to them. As to the parts (which abide permanently),
and which are hollow, such as the branches,
they receive from the root the sap which is to fill them;
for they have a nature different (from that of the
leaves, flowers, and fruits). Consequently, it is the
branches' extremities that experience "passions" (or
modifications) which they seem to derive only from the
contiguous parts. The parts contiguous to the Root are
passive on one end, and active on the other; but the
Principle itself is related to all. Although all the parts
issue from the same <span class="locked">Principle,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span> yet they differ from
each other more as they are more distant from the root.
Such would be the mutual relations of two brothers
who resemble each other because they are born from
the same parents.</p>

<span class="smaller">The Self-Consciousnesses, and What is Above <span class="locked">Them.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span></span></h2>

<h3>IS KNOWLEDGE DEPENDENT ON THE COMPOSITENESS
OF THE KNOWER?</h3>

<p>1. Must thought, and self-consciousness imply being
composed of different parts, and on their mutual contemplation?
Must that which is absolutely simple be
unable to turn towards itself, to know itself? ls it, on
the contrary, possible that for that which is not composite
to know itself? Self-consciousness, indeed, does
not necessarily result from a thing's knowing itself because
it is composite, and that one of its parts grasps
the other; as, for instance, by sensation we perceive the
form and nature of our body. In this case the whole
will not be known, unless the part that knows the
others to which it is united also knows itself; otherwise,
we would find the knowledge of one entity, through
another, instead of one entity through itself.</p>

<h3>A SIMPLE PRINCIPLE CAN HAVE SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.</h3>

<p>While, therefore, asserting that a simple principle
does know itself, we must examine into the possibility
of <span class="locked">this.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> Otherwise, we would have to give up hope of
real self-knowledge. But to resign this would imply
many absurdities; for if it be absurd to deny that the
soul possesses self-knowledge, it would be still more
absurd to deny it of intelligence. How could intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1091" id="Page_1091">1091</a></span>
have knowledge of other beings, if it did not
possess the knowledge and science of itself? Indeed,
exterior things are perceived by sensation, and even, if
you insist, by discursive reason and opinion; but not
by intelligence. It is indeed worth examining whether
intelligence does, or does not have knowledge of such
external things. Evidently, intelligible entities are
known by intelligence. Does intelligence limit itself
to knowledge of these entities, or does it, while knowing
intelligible entities, also know itself? In this case,
does it know that it knows only intelligible entities,
without being able to know what itself is? While
knowing that it knows what belongs to it, is it unable
to know what itself, the knower, is? Or can it at the
same time know what belongs to it, and also know
itself? Then how does this knowledge operate, and
how far does it go? This is what we must examine.</p>

<h3>THE SENSE-POWER OF THE SOUL DEALS ONLY WITH
EXTERIOR THINGS.</h3>

<p>2. Let us begin by a consideration of the soul.
Does she possess self-consciousness? By what faculty?
And how does she acquire it? It is natural for the sense-power
to deal only with exterior objects; for even in
the case in which it feels occurrences in the body, it is
still perceiving things that are external to it, since it
perceives passions experienced by the body over which
it presides.<a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<h3>FUNCTIONS OF THE DISCURSIVE REASON OF THE
SOUL.</h3>

<p>Besides the above, the soul possesses the discursive
reason, which judges of sense-representations, combining
and dividing them. Under the form of images, she
also considers the conceptions received from intelligence,
and operates on these images as on images<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1092" id="Page_1092">1092</a></span>
furnished by sensation. Finally, she still is the power of
understanding, since she distinguishes the new images
from the old, and harmonizes them by comparing
them; whence, indeed, our reminiscences are derived.</p>

<h3>CAN DISCURSIVE REASON TURN UPON ITSELF?</h3>

<p>That is the limit of the intellectual power of the
soul. Is it, besides, capable of turning upon itself, and
cognizing itself, or must this knowledge be sought for
only within intelligence? If we assign this knowledge
to the intellectual part of the soul; we will be making
an intelligence out of it; and we will then have to study
in what it differs from the superior Intelligence. If
again, we refuse this knowledge to this part of the soul,
we will, by reason, rise to Intelligence, and we will have
to examine the nature of self-consciousness. Further,
if we attribute this knowledge both to the inferior and
to the superior intelligences, we shall have to distinguish
self-consciousness according as it belongs to the one or
to the other; for if there were no difference between
these two kinds of intelligence, discursive reason would
be identical with pure Intelligence. Does discursive
reason, therefore, turn upon itself? Or does it limit
itself to the comprehension of the types received from
both (sense and intelligence); and, in the latter case,
how does it achieve such comprehension? This latter
question is the one to be examined here.</p>

<h3>THE HIGHEST PART OF DISCURSIVE REASON RECEIVES
IMPRESSIONS FROM INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>3. Now let us suppose that the senses have perceived
a man, and have furnished an appropriate image
thereof to discursive reason. What will the latter say?
It may say nothing, limiting itself to taking notice of
him. However, it may also ask itself who this man is;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1093" id="Page_1093">1093</a></span>
and, having already met him, with the aid of
memory, decide that he is Socrates. If then discursive
reason develop the image of Socrates, then it divides
what imagination has furnished. If discursive
reason add that Socrates is good, it still deals with things
known by the senses; but that which it asserts thereof,
namely, his goodness, it has drawn from itself, because
within itself it possesses the rule of goodness. But how
does it, within itself, possess goodness? Because it
conforms to the Good, and receives the notion of it
from the Intelligence that enlightens itself; for (discursive
reason), this part of the soul, is pure, and receives
impressions from <span class="locked">Intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span></p>

<h3>WHY DISCURSIVE REASON SHOULD BELONG TO THE
SOUL RATHER THAN TO INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>But why should this whole (soul-) part that is superior
to sensation be assigned to the soul rather than
to intelligence? Because the power of the soul consists
in reasoning, and because all these operations belong
to the discursive reason. But why can we not
simply assign to it, in addition, self-consciousness,
which would immediately clear up this inquiry? Because
the nature of discursive reason consists in considering
exterior things, and in scrutinizing their diversity,
while to intelligence we attribute the privilege
of contemplating itself, and of contemplating its own
contents. But what hinders discursive reason, by some
other faculty of the soul, from considering what belongs
to it? Because, in this case, instead of discursive
reason and reasoning, we would have pure Intelligence.
But what then hinders the presence of pure Intelligence
within the soul? Nothing, indeed. Shall we then
have a right to say that pure Intelligence is a part of
the soul? No indeed; but still we would have the
right to call it "ours." It is different from, and higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1094" id="Page_1094">1094</a></span>
than discursive reason; and still it is "ours," although
we cannot count it among the parts of the soul. In
one respect it is "ours," and in another, is not "ours;"
for at times we make use of it, and at other times we
make use of discursive reason; consequently, intelligence
is "ours" when we make use of it; and it is not
"ours" when we do not make use of it. But what is
the meaning of "making use of intelligence"? Does
it mean becoming intelligence, and speaking in that
character, or does it mean speaking in conformity with
intelligence? For we are not intelligence; we speak
in conformity with intelligence by the first part of discursive
reason, the part that receives impressions from
Intelligence. We feel through sensation, and it is we
who feel. Is it also we who conceive and who simultaneously
are conceived? Or is it we who reason, and
who conceive the intellectual notions which enlighten
discursive reason? We are indeed essentially constituted
by discursive reason. The actualizations of
Intelligence are superior to us, while those of sensation
are inferior; as to us, "we" are the principal part of
the soul, the part that forms a middle power between
these two extremes, now lowering ourselves towards
sensation, now rising towards <span class="locked">Intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> We acknowledge
sensibility to be ours because we are continually
feeling. It is not as evident that intelligence
is ours, because we do not make use of it continuously,
and because it is separated, in this sense, that it is not
intelligence that inclines towards us, but rather we who
raise our glances towards intelligence. Sensation is
our messenger, Intelligence is our <span class="locked">king.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span></p>

<h3>WE CAN THINK IN CONFORMITY WITH
INTELLIGENCE IN TWO WAYS.</h3>

<p>4. We ourselves are kings when we think in conformity
with intelligence. This, however, can take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1095" id="Page_1095">1095</a></span>
place in two ways. Either we have received from intelligence
the impressions and rules which are, as it
were, engraved within us, so that we are, so to speak,
filled with intelligence; or we can have the perception
and intuition of it, because it is present with us. When
we see intelligence, we recognize that by contemplation
of it we ourselves are grasping other intelligible
entities. This may occur in two ways; either because,
by the help of this very power, we grasp the power
which cognizes intelligible entities; or because we ourselves
become intelligence. The man who thus knows
himself is double. Either he knows discursive reason,
which is characteristic of the soul, or, rising to a
superior condition, he cognizes himself and is united
with intelligence. Then, by intelligence, that man
thinks himself; no more indeed as being man, but as
having become superior to man, as having been transported
into the intelligible Reason, and drawing thither
with himself the best part of the soul, the one which
alone is capable of taking flight towards thought, and
of receiving the fund of knowledge resulting from his
intuition. But does discursive reason not know that
it is discursive reason, and that its domain is the comprehension
of external objects? Does it not, while
doing so, know that it judges? Does it not know that
it is judging by means of the rules derived from intelligence,
which itself contains? Does it not know that
above it is a principle which possesses intelligible entities,
instead of seeking (merely) to know them?
But what would this faculty be if it did not know
what it is, and what its functions are? It knows,
therefore, that it depends on intelligence, that it is
inferior to intelligence, and that it is the image of intelligence,
that it contains the rules of intelligence as
it were engraved within itself, such as intelligence engraves
them, or rather, has engraved them on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1096" id="Page_1096">1096</a></span></p>

<h3>MAN IS SELF-CONSCIOUS BY BECOMING
INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>Will he who thus knows himself content himself
therewith? Surely not. Exercising a further faculty,
we will have the intuition of the intelligence that
knows itself; or, seizing it, inasmuch as it is "ours"
and we are "its," we will thus cognize intelligence, and
know ourselves. This is necessary for our knowledge
of what, within intelligence, self-consciousness is. The
man becomes intelligence when, abandoning his other
faculties, he by intelligence sees Intelligence, and he
sees himself in the same manner that Intelligence sees
itself.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE IS NOT DIVISIBLE; AND, IN ITS
EXISTENCE, IS IDENTICAL WITH THOUGHT.</h3>

<p>5. Does pure Intelligence know itself by contemplating
one of its parts by means of another part?
Then one part will be the subject, and another part
will be the object of contemplation; intelligence will
not know itself. It may be objected that if intelligence
be a whole composed of absolutely similar parts, so
that the subject and the object of contemplation will
not differ from each other; then, by the virtue of this
similitude, on seeing one of its parts with which it is
identical, intelligence will see itself; for, in this case,
the subject does not differ from the object. To begin
with, it is absurd to suppose that intelligence is divided
into several parts. How, indeed, would such a division
be carried out? Not by chance, surely. Who will
carry it out? Will it be the subject or object? Then,
how would the subject know itself if, in contemplation,
it located itself in the object, since contemplation does
not belong to that which is the object? Will it know
itself as object rather than as subject? In that case
it will not know itself completely and in its totality (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1097" id="Page_1097">1097</a></span>
subject and object); for what it sees is the object, and
not the subject of contemplation; it sees not itself, but
another. In order to attain complete knowledge of
itself it will, besides, have to see itself as subject; now,
if it see itself as subject, it will, at the same time, have
to see the contemplated things. But is it the (Stoic<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>)
"types" (or impressions) of things, or the things
themselves, that are contained in the actualization of
contemplation? If it be these impressions, we do not
possess the things themselves. If we do possess these
things, it is not because we separate ourselves (into
subject and object). Before dividing ourselves in this
way, we already saw and possessed these things. Consequently,
contemplation must be identical with that
which is contemplated, and intelligence must be identical
with the intelligible. Without this identity, we will
never possess the truth. Instead of possessing realities,
we will never possess any more than their impressions,
which will differ from the realities; consequently, this
will not be the truth. Truth, therefore, must not
differ from its object; it must be what it asserts.</p>

<h3>THOUGHT IS IDENTICAL WITH THE INTELLIGIBLE
WHICH IS AN ACTUALIZATION.</h3>

<p>On one hand, therefore, intelligence, and on the
other the intelligible and existence form but one and
the same thing, namely, the primary existence and
primary Intelligence, which possesses realities, or
rather, which is identical with them. But if the
thought-object and the thought together form but a
single entity, how will the thinking object thus be able
to think itself? Evidently thought will embrace the
intelligible, or will be identical therewith; but we still
do not see how intelligence is to think itself. Here
we are: thought and the intelligible fuse into one because
the intelligible is an actualization and not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1098" id="Page_1098">1098</a></span>
simple power; because life is neither alien nor incidental
to it; because thought is not an accident for it, as it
would be for a brute body, as for instance, for a stone;
and, finally, because the intelligible is primary "being."
Now, if the intelligible be an actualization, it is the
primary actualization, the most perfect thought, or,
"substantial thought." Now, as this thought is supremely
true, as it is primary Thought, as it possesses
existence in the highest degree, it is primary Intelligence.
It is not, therefore, mere potential intelligence;
there is no need to distinguish within it the
potentiality from the actualization of thought; otherwise,
its substantiality would be merely potential. Now
since intelligence is an actualization, and as its "being"
also is an actualization, it must fuse with its actualization.
But existence and the intelligible also fuse with
their actualization. <span class="locked">Therefore<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> intelligence, the intelligible,
and thought will form but one and the same
entity. Since the thought of the intelligible is the
intelligible, and as the intelligible is intelligence, intelligence
will thus think itself. Intelligence will think,
by the actualization of the thought to which it is identical,
the intelligible to which it also is identical. It
will think itself, so far as it is thought; and in so far
as it is the intelligible which it thinks by the thought
to which it is identical.<a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<h3>SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS MORE PERFECT IN
INTELLIGENCE THAN IN THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>6. Reason, therefore, demonstrates that there is a
principle which must essentially know itself. But this
self-consciousness is more perfect in intelligence than
in the soul. The soul knows herself in so far as she
knows that she depends on another power; while intelligence,
by merely turning towards itself, naturally
cognizes its existence and "being." By contemplating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1099" id="Page_1099">1099</a></span>
realities, it contemplates itself; this contemplation is
an actualization, and this actualization is intelligence;
for intelligence and thought<a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> form but a single entity.
The entire intelligence sees itself entire, instead of
seeing one of its parts by another of its parts. Is it
in the nature of intelligence, such as reason conceives
of it, to produce within us a simple conviction? No.
Intelligence necessarily implies (certitude), and not
mere persuasion; for necessity is characteristic of intelligence,
while persuasion is characteristic of the
soul. Here below, it is true, we rather seek to be
persuaded, than to see truth by pure Intelligence.
When we were in the superior region, satisfied with
intelligence, we used to think, and to contemplate the
intelligible, reducing everything to unity. It was Intelligence
which thought and spoke about itself; the
soul rested, and allowed Intelligence free scope to act.
But since we have descended here below, we seek to
produce persuasion in the soul, because we wish to
contemplate the model in its image.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL MUST BE TAUGHT SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS
BY CONVERSION.</h3>

<p>We must, therefore, teach our soul how Intelligence
contemplates itself. This has to be taught to that part
of our soul which, because of its intellectual character,
we call reason, or discursive intelligence, to indicate
that it is a kind of intelligence, that it possesses its
power by intelligence, and that it derives it from intelligence.
This part of the soul must, therefore,
know that it knows what it sees, that it knows what
it expresses, and that, if it were identical with what it
describes, it would thereby know itself. But since
intelligible entities come to it from the same principle
from which it itself comes, since it is a reason, and as it
receives from intelligence entities that are kindred, by
comparing them with the traces of intelligence it contains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1100" id="Page_1100">1100</a></span>
it must know itself. This image it contains must,
therefore, be raised to true Intelligence, which is identical
with the true intelligible entities, that is, to the
primary and really true Beings; for it is impossible that
this intelligence should originate from itself. If then
intelligence remain in itself and with itself, if it be
what it is (in its nature) to be, that is, intelligence&mdash;for
intelligence can never be unintelligent&mdash;it must
contain within it the knowledge of itself, since it does
not issue from itself, and since its function and its
"being" (or, true nature) consist in being no more
than <span class="locked">intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> It is not an intelligence that devotes
itself to practical action, obliged to consider what
is external to it, and to issue from itself to become
cognizant of exterior things; for it is not necessary
that an intelligence which devotes itself to action
should know itself. As it does not give itself to action&mdash;for,
being pure, it has nothing to desire&mdash;it operates
a conversion towards itself, by virtue of which it is
not only probable, but even necessary for it to know
itself. Otherwise, what would its life consist of,
inasmuch as it does not devote itself to action, and as
it remains within itself?</p>

<h3>WHATEVER INTELLIGENCE MAY BE THOUGHT TO
DO, IT MUST KNOW ITSELF.</h3>

<p>7. It may be objected that the Intelligence contemplates
the divinity. If, however, it be granted,
that the Intelligence knows the divinity, one is thereby
forced to admit that it also knows itself; for it will
know what it derives from the divinity, what it has
received from Him, and what it still may hope to
receive from Him. By knowing this, it will know
itself, since it is one of the entities given by the divinity;
or rather, since it is all that is given by the
divinity. If then, it know the divinity, it knows also
the powers of the divinity, it knows that itself proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1101" id="Page_1101">1101</a></span>
from the divinity, and that itself derives its
powers from the divinity. If Intelligence cannot
have a clear intuition of the divinity, because the
subject and object of an intuition must be the same,
this will turn out to be a reason why Intelligence
will know itself, and will see itself, since seeing
is being what is seen. What else indeed could we
attribute to Intelligence? Rest, for instance? For
Intelligence, rest does not consist in being removed
from itself, but rather to act without being disturbed
by anything that is alien. The things that are not
troubled by anything alien need only to produce their
own actualization, especially when they are in actualization,
and not merely potential. That which is in
actualization, and which cannot be in actualization for
anything foreign, must be in actualization for itself.
When thinking itself, Intelligence remains turned towards
itself, referring its actualization to itself. If
anything proceed from it, it is precisely because it remains
turned towards itself that it remains in itself. It
had, indeed, to apply itself to itself, before applying
itself to anything else, or producing something else
that resembled it; thus fire must first be fire in itself,
and be fire in actualization, in order later to impart
some traces of its nature to other things. Intelligence,
in itself, therefore, is an actualization. The soul, on
turning herself towards Intelligence, remains within
herself; on issuing from Intelligence, the soul turns
towards external things. On turning towards Intelligence,
she becomes similar to the power from which
she proceeds; on issuing from Intelligence, she becomes
different from herself. Nevertheless, she still
preserves some resemblance to Intelligence, both in her
activity and productiveness. When active, the soul
still contemplates Intelligence; when productive, the
soul produces forms, which resemble distant thoughts,
and are traces of thought and Intelligence, traces that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1102" id="Page_1102">1102</a></span>
conform to their archetype; and which reveal a faithful
imitation thereof, or which, at least, still preserve
a weakened image thereof, even if they do occupy only
the last rank of beings.</p>

<h3>WHAT INTELLIGENCE LOOKS LIKE IN THE
INTELLIGIBLE.</h3>

<p>8. What qualities does Intelligence display in the
intelligible world? What qualities does it discover in
itself by contemplation? To begin with, we must
not form of Intelligence a conception showing a figure,
or colors, like bodies. Intelligence existed before
bodies. The "seminal reasons" which produce figure
and color are not identical with them; for "seminal
reasons" are invisible. So much the more are intelligible
entities invisible; their nature is identical with
that of the principles in which they reside, just as
"seminal reasons" are identical with the soul that contains
them. But the soul does not see the entities she
contains, because she has not begotten them; even she
herself, just like the "reasons," is no more than an
image (of Intelligence). The principle from which
she comes possesses an evident existence, that is genuine,
and primary; consequently, that principle exists
of and in itself. But this image (which is in the soul)
is not even permanent unless it belong to something
else, and reside therein. Indeed, the characteristic of
an image is that it resides in something else, since it
belongs to something else, unless it remain attached
to its principle. Consequently, this image does not
contemplate, because it does not possess a light that
is sufficient; and even if it should contemplate, as it
finds its perfection in something else, it would be contemplating
something else, instead of contemplating
itself. The same case does not obtain in Intelligence;
there the contemplated entity and contemplation co-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1103" id="Page_1103">1103</a></span>exist,
and are identical. Who is it, therefore, that
declares the nature of the intelligible? The power
that contemplates it, namely, Intelligence itself. Here
below our eyes see the light because our vision itself
is light, or rather because it is united to light; for it
is the colors that our vision beholds. On the contrary,
Intelligence does not see through something else, but
through itself, because what it sees is not outside of
itself. It sees a light with another light, and not by
another light; it, is therefore, a light that sees another;
and, consequently, it sees itself. This light, on shining
in the soul, illuminates her; that is, intellectualizes her;
assimilates her to the superior light (namely, in Intelligence).
If, by the ray with which this light enlightens
the soul, we judge of the nature of this light and conceive
of it as still greater, more beautiful, and more
brilliant, we will indeed be approaching Intelligence
and the intelligible world; for, by enlightening the
soul, Intelligence imparts to her a clearer life. This
life is not generative, because Intelligence converts the
soul towards Intelligence; and, instead of allowing the
soul to divide, causes the soul to love the splendor with
which she is shining. Neither is this life one of the
senses, for though the senses apply themselves to what
is exterior, they do not, on that account, learn anything
beyond (themselves). He who sees that superior
light of the verities sees much better things that are
visible, though in a different manner. It remains,
therefore, that the Intelligence imparts to the soul the
intellectual life, which is a trace of her own life; for
Intelligence possesses the realities. It is in the life
and the actualization which are characteristic of Intelligence
that here consists the primary Light, which
from the <span class="locked">beginning,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span> illumines itself, which reflects
on itself, because it is simultaneously enlightener and
enlightened; it is also the true intelligible entity, because
it is also at the same time thinker and thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1104" id="Page_1104">1104</a></span>
It sees itself by itself, without having need of anything
else; it sees itself in an absolute manner, because,
within it, the known is identical with the knower. It
is not otherwise in us; it is by Intelligence that we
know intelligence. Otherwise, how could we speak
of it? How could we say that it was capable of clearly
grasping itself, and that, by it, we understand ourselves?
How could we, by these reasonings, to Intelligence
reduce our soul which recognizes that it is the
image of Intelligence, which considers its life a faithful
imitation of the life of Intelligence, which thinks that,
when it thinks, it assumes an intellectual and divine
form? Should one wish to know which is this Intelligence
that is perfect, universal and primary, which
knows itself essentially, the soul has to be reduced to
Intelligence; or, at least, the soul has to recognize that
the actualization by which the soul conceives the entities
of which the soul has the reminiscence is derived
from Intelligence. Only by placing herself in that condition,
does the soul become able to demonstrate that
inasmuch as she is the image of Intelligence she, the
soul, can by herself, see it; that is, by those of her
powers which most exactly resemble Intelligence
(namely, by pure thought); which resembles Intelligence
in the degree that a part of the soul can be
assimilated to it.</p>

<h3>WE CAN REACH A CONCEPTION OF INTELLIGENCE
BY STRIPPING THE SOUL OF EVERY FACULTY
EXCEPT HER INTELLECTUAL PART.</h3>

<p>9. We must, therefore, contemplate the soul and
her divinest part in order to discover the nature of Intelligence.
This is how we may accomplish it: From
man, that is from yourself, strip off the body; then
that power of the soul that fashions the body; then
sensation, appetite, and anger, and all the lower passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1105" id="Page_1105">1105</a></span>
that incline you towards the earth. What then
remains of the soul is what we call the "image of
intelligence," an image that radiates from Intelligence,
as from the immense globe of the sun radiates the
surrounding luminary sphere. Of course, we would
not say that all the light that radiates from the sun
remains within itself around the sun; only a part of
this light remains around the sun from which it emanates;
another part, spreading by relays, descends to
us on the earth. But we consider light, even that which
surrounds the sun, as located in something else, so as
not to be forced to consider the whole space between
the sun and us as empty of all bodies. On the contrary,
the soul is a light which remains attached to
Intelligence, and she is not located in any space because
Intelligence itself is not spatially located. While
the light of the sun is in the air, on the contrary the
soul, in the state in which we consider her here, is so
pure that she can be seen in herself by herself, and
by any other soul that is in the same condition. The
soul needs to reason, in order to conceive of the nature
of Intelligence according to her own nature; but Intelligence
conceives of itself without reasoning because
it is always present to itself. We, on the contrary,
are present both to ourselves and to Intelligence
when we turn towards it, because our life is divided
into several lives. On the contrary, Intelligence has
no need of any other life, nor of anything else; what
Intelligence gives is not given to itself, but to other
things; neither does Intelligence have any need of what
is inferior to it; nor could Intelligence give itself anything
inferior, since Intelligence possesses all things;
instead of possessing in itself the primary images of
things (as in the case of the soul), Intelligence is these
things themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1106" id="Page_1106">1106</a></span></p>

<h3>ELEVATION OF THE SOUL MAY BE GRADUAL, IF
UNABLE TO ATTAIN IMMEDIATE ELEVATION.</h3>

<p>If one should find himself unable to rise immediately
to pure thought, which is the highest, or first, part of
the soul, he may begin by opinion, and from it rise to
Intelligence. If even opinion be out of the reach of
his ability, he may begin with sensation, which already
represents general forms; for sensation which contains
the forms potentially may possess them even in actualization.
If, on the contrary, the best he can do is to
descend, let him descend to the generative power, and
to the things it produces; then, from the last forms,
one may rise again to the higher forms, and so on to
the primary forms.</p>

<h3>THE TRANSCENDENT FIRST PRINCIPLE HAS NO
NEED OF SEEING ITSELF.</h3>

<p>10. But enough of this. If the (forms) contained
by Intelligence are not created forms&mdash;otherwise the
forms contained in us would no longer, as they should,
occupy the lowest rank&mdash;if these forms in intelligence
really be creative and primary, then either these
creative forms and the creative principle fuse into one
single entity, or intelligence needs some other principle.
But does the transcendent Principle, that is
superior to Intelligence (the One), itself also need
some other further principle? No, because it is only
Intelligence that stands in need of such an one. Does
the Principle superior to Intelligence (the transcendent
One) not see Himself? No. He does not need to
see Himself. This we shall study elsewhere.</p>

<h3>THE CONTEMPLATION OF INTELLIGENCE DEMANDS
A HIGHER TRANSCENDING UNITY.</h3>

<p>Let us now return to our most important problem.
Intelligence needs to contemplate itself, or rather, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1107" id="Page_1107">1107</a></span>
continually possesses this contemplation. It first sees
that it is manifold, and then that it implies a difference,
and further, that it needs to contemplate, to contemplate
the intelligible, and that its very essence is to
contemplate. Indeed, every contemplation implies an
object; otherwise, it is empty. To make contemplation
possible there must be more than an unity; contemplation
must be applied to an object, and this object
must be manifold; for what is simple has no object on
which it could apply its action, and silently remains
withdrawn in its solitude. Action implies some sort
of difference. Otherwise, to what would action apply
itself? What would be its object? The active principle,
must, therefore, direct its action on something
else than itself, or must itself be manifold to direct
its action on itself. If, indeed, it direct its action on
nothing, it will be at rest; and if at rest, it will not be
thinking. The thinking principle, therefore, when
thinking, implies duality. Whether the two terms be
one exterior to the other, or united, thought always
implies both identity and difference. In general, intelligible
entities must simultaneously be identical with
Intelligence, and different from Intelligence. Besides,
each of them must also contain within itself identity
and difference. Otherwise, if the intelligible does not
contain any diversity, what would be the object of
thought? If you insist that each intelligible entity
resembles a ("seminal) reason," it must be manifold.
Every intelligible entity, therefore, knows itself to be
a compound, and many-colored eye. If intelligence
applied itself to something single and absolutely simple,
it could not think. What would it say? What
would it understand? If the indivisible asserted itself
it ought first to assert what it is not; and so, in order
to be single it would have to be manifold. If it said,
"I am this," and if it did not assert that "this" was
different from itself, it would be uttering untruth. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1108" id="Page_1108">1108</a></span>
it asserted it as an accident of itself, it would assert
of itself a multitude. If it says, "I am; I am; myself;
myself;" then neither these two things will be simple,
and each of them will be able to say, "me;" or there
will be manifoldness, and, consequently, a difference;
and, consequently, number and diversity. The thinking
subject must, therefore, contain a difference, just
as the object thought must also reveal a diversity, because
it is divided by thought. Otherwise, there will
be no other thought of the intelligible, but a kind of
touch, of unspeakable and inconceivable contact, prior
to intelligence, since intelligence is not yet supposed to
exist, and as the possessor of this contact does not
think. The thinking subject, therefore, must not remain
simple, especially, when it thinks itself; it must
split itself, even were the comprehension of itself
silent. Last, that which is simple (the One) has no
need of occupying itself with itself. What would it
learn by thinking? Is it not what it is before thinking
itself? Besides, knowledge implies that some one
desires, that some one seeks, and that some one finds.
That which does not within itself contain any difference,
when turned towards itself, rests without seeking
anything within itself; but that which develops, is
manifold.</p>

<h3>HOW INTELLIGENCE BECAME MANIFOLD.</h3>

<p>11. Intelligence, therefore, becomes manifold
when it wishes to think the Principle superior to it.
By wishing to grasp Him in his simplicity, it abandons
this simplicity, because it continues to receive within
itself this differentiated and multiplied nature. It
was not yet Intelligence when it issued from Unity;
it found itself in the state of sight when not yet actualized.
When emanating from Unity, it contained
already what made it manifold. It vaguely aspired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1109" id="Page_1109">1109</a></span>
an object other than itself, while simultaneously containing
a representation of this object. It thus contained
something that it made manifold; for it contained
a sort of impress produced by the contemplation
(of the One); otherwise it would not receive the One
within itself. Thus Intelligence, on being born of
Unity, became manifold, and as it possessed knowledge,
it contemplated itself. It then became actualized
sight. Intelligence is really intelligence only when
it possesses its object, and when it possesses it as intelligence.
Formerly, it was only an aspiration, only
an indistinct vision. On applying itself to the One,
and grasping the One, it becomes intelligence. Now
its receptivity to Unity is continuous, and it is continuously
intelligence, "being," thought, from the very
moment it begins to think. Before that, it is not yet
thought, since it does not possess the intelligible, and
is not yet Intelligence, since it does not think.</p>

<h3>THE ONE IS THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL WITHOUT
BEING LIMITED THEREBY.</h3>

<p>That which is above these things is their principle,
without being inherent in them. The principle from
which these things proceed cannot be inherent in them;
that is true only of the elements that constitute them.
The principle from which all things proceed (the One)
is not any of them; it differs from all of them. The
One, therefore, is not any of them; it differs from all
of them. The One, therefore, is not any of the things
of the universe: He precedes all these things, and consequently,
He precedes Intelligence, since the latter embraces
all things in its universality. On the other
hand, as the things that are posterior to Unity are
universal, and as Unity thus is anterior to universal
things, it cannot be any one of them. Therefore, it
should not be called either intelligence or good, if by
"good" you mean any object comprised within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1110" id="Page_1110">1110</a></span>
universe; this name suits it only, if it indicate that it is
anterior to everything. If Intelligence be intelligence
only because it is manifold; if thought, though found
within Intelligence, be similarly manifold, then the
First, the Principle that is absolutely simple, will be
above Intelligence; for if He think, He would be Intelligence;
and if He be Intelligence, He would be
manifold.</p>

<h3>NO MANIFOLDNESS OF ANY KIND CAN EXIST IN
THE FIRST.</h3>

<p>12. It may be objected, that nothing would hinder
the existence of manifoldness in the actualization of
the First, so long as the "being," or nature, remain
unitary. That principle would not be rendered composite
by any number of actualizations. This is not
the case for two reasons. Either these actualizations
are distinct from its nature ("being"), and the First
would pass from potentiality to actuality; in which
case, without doubt, the First is not manifold, but His
nature would not become perfect without actualization.
Or the nature ("being") is, within Him identical
to His actualization; in which case, as the actualization
is manifold, the nature would be such also. Now we
do indeed grant that Intelligence is manifold, since it
thinks itself; but we could not grant that the Principle
of all things should also be manifold. Unity must
exist before the manifold, the reason of whose existence
is found in unity; for unity precedes all number.
It may be objected that this is true enough for numbers
which follow unity, because they are composite;
but what is the need of a unitary principle from which
manifoldness should proceed when referring (not to
numerals, but) to beings? This need is that, without
the One, all things would be in a dispersed condition,
and their combinations would be no more than a chaos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1111" id="Page_1111">1111</a></span></p>

<h3>PERMANENT ACTUALIZATIONS ARE HYPOSTASES.</h3>

<p>Another objection is, that from an intelligence that
is simple, manifold actualizations can surely proceed.
This then admits the existence of something simple
before the actualizations. Later, as these actualizations
become permanent, they form hypostatic forms
of existence. Being such, they will have to differ
from the Principle from which they proceed, since
the Principle remains simple, and that which is born
of it must in itself be manifold, and be dependent
thereon. Even if these actualizations exist only because
the Principle acted a single time, this already
constitutes manifoldness. Though these actualizations
be the first ones, if they constitute second-rank
(nature), the first rank will belong to the Principle
that precedes these actualizations; this Principle abides
in itself, while these actualizations constitute that
which is of second rank, and is composed of actualizations.
The First differs from the actualizations He
begets, because He begets them without activity; otherwise,
Intelligence would not be the first actualization.
Nor should we think that the One first desired to beget
Intelligence, and later begat it, so that this desire was
an intermediary between the generating principle and
the generated entity. The One could not have desired
anything; for if He had desired anything, He
would have been imperfect, since He would not yet
have possessed what He desired. Nor could we suppose
that the One lacked anything; for there was
nothing towards which He could have moved. Therefore,
the hypostatic form of existence which is beneath
Him received existence from Him, without
ceasing to persist in its own condition. Therefore, if
there is to be a hypostatic form of existence beneath
Him He must have remained within Himself in perfect
tranquility; otherwise, He would have initiated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1112" id="Page_1112">1112</a></span>
movement; and we would have to conceive of a
movement before the first movement, a thought before
the first thought, and its first actualization would
be imperfect, consisting in no more than a mere tendency.
But towards what can the first actualization of
the One tend, and attain, if, according to the dictates
of reason, we conceive of that actualization originating
from Him as light emanates from the sun? This actualization,
therefore, will have to be considered as a light
that embraces the whole intelligible world; at the
summit of which we shall have to posit, and over
whose throne we shall have to conceive the rule of
the immovable One, without separating Him from the
Light that radiates from Him. Otherwise, above this
Light we would have to posit another one, which,
while remaining immovable, should enlighten the intelligible.
Indeed the actualization that emanates
from the One, without being separated from Him,
nevertheless, differs from Him. Neither is its nature
non-essential, or blind; it, therefore, contemplates
itself, and knows itself; it is, consequently, the first
knowing principle. As the One is above Intelligence,
it is also above consciousness; as it needs nothing,
neither has it any need of knowing anything. Cognition
(or, consciousness), therefore, belongs only to the
second-rank nature. Consciousness is only an individual
unity, while the One is absolute unity; indeed
individual unity is not absolute Unity, because the
absolute is (or, "in and for itself"), precedes the
("somehow determined," or) individual.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME IS ABSOLUTELY INEFFABLE.</h3>

<p>13. This Principle, therefore, is really indescribable.
We are individualizing it in any statement about
it. That which is above everything, even above the
venerable Intelligence, really has no name, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1113" id="Page_1113">1113</a></span>
that we can state about Him is, that He is not anything.
Nor can He be given any name, since we
cannot assert anything about Him. We refer to Him
only as best we can. In our uncertainty we say,
"What does He not feel? is He not self-conscious?
does He not know Himself?" Then we must reflect
that by speaking thus we are thinking of things, that
are opposed to Him of whom we are now thinking.
When we suppose that He can be known, or that He
possesses self-consciousness, we are already making
Him manifold. Were we to attribute to Him thought,
it would appear that He needed this thought. If we
imagine thought as being within Him, thought seems
to be superfluous. For of what does thought consist?
Of the consciousness of the totality formed by
the two terms that contribute to the act of thought,
and which fuse therein. That is thinking oneself, and
thinking oneself is real thinking; for each of the two
elements of thought is itself an unity to which nothing
is lacking. On the contrary, the thought of objects
exterior (to Intelligence) is not perfect, and is not
true thought. That which is supremely simple and
supremely absolute stands in need of nothing. The
absolute that occupies the second rank needs itself,
and, consequently, needs to think itself. Indeed, since
Intelligence needs something relatively to itself, it succeeds
in satisfying this need, and consequently, in being
absolute, only by possessing itself entirely. It suffices
itself only by uniting all the elements constituting its
nature ("being"), only by dwelling within itself, only
by remaining turned towards itself while thinking; for
consciousness is the sensation of manifoldness, as is
indicated by the etymology of the word "con-scious-ness,"
or, "conscience." If supreme Thought occur
by the conversion of Intelligence towards itself, it
evidently is manifold. Even if it said no more than
"I am existence," Intelligence would say it as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1114" id="Page_1114">1114</a></span>
making a discovery, and Intelligence would be right,
because existence is manifold. Even though it should
apply itself to something simple, and should say, "I am
existence," this would not imply successful grasp of
itself or existence. Indeed, when Intelligence speaks
of existence in conformity with reality, intelligence
does not speak of it as of a stone, but, merely, in a
single word expresses something manifold. The existence
that really and essentially deserves the name of
existence, instead of having of it only a trace which
would not be existence, and which would be only an
image of it, such existence is a multiple entity. Will
not each one of the elements of this multiple entity
be thought? No doubt you will not be able to think
it if you take it alone and separated from the others;
but existence itself is in itself something manifold.
Whatever object you name, it possesses existence.
Consequently, He who is supremely simple cannot
think Himself; if He did, He would be somewhere,
(which is not the case). Therefore He does not
think, and He cannot be grasped by thought.</p>

<h3>WE COME SUFFICIENTLY NEAR TO HIM TO TALK
ABOUT HIM.</h3>

<p>14. How then do we speak of Him? Because we
can assert something about Him, though we cannot
express Him by speech. We could not know Him, nor
grasp Him by thought. How then do we speak of
Him, if we cannot grasp Him? Because though He
does escape our knowledge, He does not escape us
completely. We grasp Him enough to assert something
about Him without expressing Him himself, to
say what He is not, without saying what He is; that
is why in speaking of Him we use terms that are suitable
to designate only lower things. Besides we can
embrace Him without being capable of expressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1115" id="Page_1115">1115</a></span>
Him, like men who, transported by a divine enthusiasm,
feel that they contain something superior without being
able to account for it. They speak of what agitates
them, and they thus have some feeling of Him who
moves them, though they differ therefrom. Such is
our relation with Him; when we rise to Him by using
our pure intelligence, we feel that He is the foundation
of our intelligence, the principle that furnishes
"being" and other things of the kind; we feel that He
is better, greater, and more elevated than we, because
He is superior to reason, to intelligence, and to the
senses, because He gives these things without being
what they are.</p>

<h3>RADIATION OF MULTIPLE UNITY.</h3>

<p>15. How does He give them? Is it because He
possesses them, or because He does not possess them?
If it be because He does not possess them, how does
He give what He does not possess? If it be because
He does possess them, He is no longer simple. If He
give what He does not possess, how is multiplicity born
of Him? It would seem as if only one single thing
could proceed from Him, unity; and even so one might
wonder how anything whatever could be born of that
which is absolutely one. We answer, in the same way
as from a light radiates a luminous sphere (or, <span class="locked">fulguration<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span>).
But how can the manifold be born from the
One? Because the thing that proceeds from Him
must not be equal to Him, and so much the less, superior;
for what is superior to unity, or better than
Him? It must, therefore, be inferior to Him, and,
consequently, be less perfect. Now it cannot be less
perfect, except on condition of being less unitary, that
is, more manifold. But as it must aspire to unity, it
will be the "manifold one." It is by that which is
single that that which is not single is preserved, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1116" id="Page_1116">1116</a></span>
is what it is; for that which is not one, though composite,
cannot receive the name of existence. If it be
possible to say what each thing is, it is only because
it is one and identical. What is not manifold is not
one by participation, but is absolute unity; it does not
derive its unity from any other principle; on the contrary
it is the principle to which other things owe
that they are more or less single, according as they are
more or less close to it. Since the characteristic of
that which is nearest to unity is identity, and is posterior
to unity, evidently the manifoldness contained therein,
must be the totality of things that are single. For
since manifoldness is therein united with manifoldness,
it does not contain parts separated from each other,
and all subsist together. Each of the things, that proceed
therefrom, are manifold unity, because they cannot
be universal unity. Universal unity is characteristic
only of their principle (the intelligible Being), because
itself proceeds from a great Principle which is one,
essentially, and genuinely. That which, by its exuberant
fruitfulness, begets, is all; on the other hand, as
this totality participates in unity, it is single; and, consequently,
it is single totality (universal unity).</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME PRODUCES MANIFOLDNESS BECAUSE
OF ITS CATEGORIES.</h3>

<p>We have seen that existence is "all these things;"
now, what are they? All those of which the One is
the principle. But how can the One be the principle
of all things? Because the One preserves their existence
while effecting the individuality of each of them.
Is it also because He gives them existence? And if so,
does He do so by possessing them? In this case, the
One would be manifold. No, it is by containing them
without any distinction yet having arisen among them.
On the contrary, in the second principle they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1117" id="Page_1117">1117</a></span>
distinguished by reason; that is, they are logically
distinguished, because this second principle is an actualization,
while the first Principle is the <span class="locked">power-potentiality<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span>
of all things; not in the sense in which
we say that matter is potential in that it receives, or
suffers, but in the opposite sense that the One produces.
How then can the One produce what it does
not possess, since unity produces that neither by
chance nor by reflection? We have already said that
what proceeds from unity must differ from it; and,
consequently, cannot be absolutely one; that it must
be duality, and, consequently, multitude, since it will
contain (the categories, such as) identity, and difference,
quality, and so <span class="locked">forth.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span> We have demonstrated
that that which is born of the One is not absolutely
one. It now remains for us to inquire whether it will
be manifold, such as it is seen to be in what proceeds
from the One. We shall also have to consider why it
necessarily proceeds from the One.</p>

<h3>THE GOOD MUST BE SUPERIOR TO INTELLIGENCE
AND LIFE.</h3>

<p>16. We have shown elsewhere that something
must follow the One, and that the One is a power, and
is inexhaustible; and this is so, because even the last-rank
entities possess the power of begetting. For the
present we may notice that the generation of things
reveals a descending procession, in which, the further
we go, the more does manifoldness increase; and that
the principle is always simpler than the things it <span class="locked">produces.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span>
Therefore, that which has produced the
sense world is not the sense-world itself, but Intelligence
and the intelligible world; and that which has
begotten Intelligence and the intelligible world is
neither Intelligence nor the intelligible world, but
something simpler than them. Manifoldness is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1118" id="Page_1118">1118</a></span>
born of manifoldness, but of something that is not
manifold. If That which was superior to Intelligence
were manifold, it would no longer be the (supreme)
Principle, and we would have to ascend further.
Everything must, therefore, be reduced to that which
is essentially one, which is outside of all manifoldness;
and whose simplicity is the greatest possible. But how
can manifold and universal Reason be born of the One,
when very evidently the One is not a reason? As it
is not a reason, how can it beget Reason? How can
the Good beget a hypostatic form of existence, which
would be good in form? What does this hypostatic
form of existence possess? Is it identity? But what
is the relation between identity and goodness? Because
as soon as we possess the Good, we seek identity
and permanence; and because the Good is the principle
from which we must not separate; for if it were not
the Good, it would be better to give it up. We must,
therefore, wish to remain united to the Good. Since
that is the most desirable for Intelligence, it need seek
nothing beyond, and its permanence indicates its satisfaction
with the entities it possesses. Enjoying, as it
does, their presence in a manner such that it fuses with
them, it must then consider life as the most precious
entity of all. As Intelligence possesses life in its universality
and fulness, this life is the fulness and universality
of the Soul and Intelligence. Intelligence, therefore,
is self-sufficient, and desires nothing; it contains
what it would have desired if it had not already possessed
such desirable object. It possesses the good
that consists in life and intelligence, as we have said,
or in some one of the connected entities. If Life and
Intelligence were the absolute Good, there would be
nothing above them. But if the absolute Good be
above them, the good of Intelligence is this Life,
which relates to the absolute Good, which connects
with it, which receives existence from it, and rises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1119" id="Page_1119">1119</a></span>
towards it, because it is its principle. The Good,
therefore, must be superior to Life and Intelligence.
On this condition only does the life of Intelligence, the
image of Him from whom all life proceeds, turn
towards Him; on this condition only does Intelligence,
the imitation of the contents of the One, whatever be
His nature, turn towards Him.</p>

<h3>THE SUPREME AS SUPERESSENTIAL AND
SUPEREXISTENT.</h3>

<p>17. What better thing is there then than this supremely
wise Life, exempt from all fault or error?
What is there better than the Intelligence that embraces
everything? In one word, what is there better
than universal Life and universal Intelligence? If we
answer that what is better than these things is the
Principle that begat them, if we content ourselves with
explaining how it begat them, and to show that one
cannot discover anything better, we shall, instead of
progressing in this discussion, ever remain at the same
point. Nevertheless, we need to rise higher. We are
particularly obliged to do this, when we consider that
the principle that we seek must be considered as the
"Self-sufficient supremely independent of all things;"
for no entity is able to be self-sufficient, and all have
participated in the One; and since they have done so,
none of them can be the One. Which then is this
principle in which all participate, which makes Intelligence
exist, and is all things? Since it makes Intelligence
exist, and since it is all things, since it makes its
contained manifoldness self-sufficient by the presence
of unity, and since it is thus the creative principle of
"being" and self-sufficiency, it must, instead of being
"being," be super-"being" and super-existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1120" id="Page_1120">1120</a></span></p>

<h3>ECSTASY IS INTELLECTUAL CONTACT WITH
SUDDEN LIGHT.</h3>

<p>Have we said enough, and can we stop here? Or
does our soul still feel the pains of parturition? Let
her, therefore, produce (activity), rushing towards the
One, driven by the pains that agitate her. No, let us
rather seek to calm her by some magic charm, if any
remedy therefor exist. But to charm the soul, it may
perhaps be sufficient to repeat what we have already
said. To what other charm, indeed, would it suffice
to have recourse? Rising above all the truths in which
we participate, this enchantment evanesces the moment
we speak, or even think. For, in order to express
something, discursive reason is obliged to go from
one thing to another, and successively to run through
every element of its object. Now what can be successively
scrutinized in that which is absolutely simple?
It is, therefore, sufficient to reach Him by a sort of
intellectual contact. Now at the moment of touching
the One, we should neither be able to say anything
about Him, nor have the leisure to speak of Him;
only later is it possible to argue about Him. We
should believe that we have seen Him when a sudden
light has enlightened the soul; for this light comes
from Him, and is Himself. We should believe that
He is present when, as another (lower) divinity, He
illumines the house of him who calls on this <span class="locked">divinity,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span>
for it remains obscure without the illumination of
the divinity. The soul, therefore, is without light
when she is deprived of the presence of this divinity,
when illumined by this divinity, she has what she
sought. The true purpose of the soul is to be in contact
with this light, to see this light in the radiance of
this light itself, without the assistance of any foreign
light, to see this principle by the help of which she
sees. Indeed, it is the principle by which she is enlightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1121" id="Page_1121">1121</a></span>
that she must contemplate as one gazes at
the sun only through its own light. But how shall we
succeed in this? By cutting off everything <span class="locked">else.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span></p>

<span class="smaller">Of Love, or "Eros."</span></h2>

<h3>LOVE AS GOD, GUARDIAN AND PASSION.</h3>

<p>1. Is Love a divinity, a guardian, or a passion of
the human soul? Or is it all three under different
points of view? In this case, what is it under each
of these points of view? These are the questions we
are to consider, consulting the opinions of men, but
chiefly those of the philosophers. The divine Plato,
who has written much about love, here deserves particular
attention. He says that it is not only a passion
capable of being born in souls, but he calls it also a
guardian, and he gives many details about its birth and
parents.<a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<h3>PASSIONAL LOVE IS TWOFOLD.</h3>

<p>To begin with passion, it is a matter of common
knowledge that the passion designated as love is born
in the souls which desire to unite themselves to a beautiful
object. But its object may be either a shameful
practice, or one (worthy to be pursued by) temperate
men, who are familiar with beauty. We must, therefore,
investigate in a philosophical manner what is the
origin of both kinds of love.</p>

<h3>LOVE IS RECOGNITION OF HIDDEN AFFINITY.</h3>

<p>The real cause of love is fourfold: the desire of
beauty; our soul's innate notion of beauty; our soul's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1123" id="Page_1123">1123</a></span>
affinity with beauty, and our soul's instinctive sentiment
of this <span class="locked">affinity.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span> (Therefore as beauty lies at
the root of love, so) ugliness is contrary to nature
and divinity. In fact, when Nature wants to create,
she contemplates what is beautiful, determinate, and
comprehended within the (Pythagorean) "sphere" of
the Good. On the contrary, the (Pythagorean) <span class="locked">"indeterminate"<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span>
is ugly, and belongs to the other <span class="locked">system.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span>
Besides, Nature herself owes her origin to the Good,
and, therefore, also to the Beautiful. Now, as soon
as one is attracted by an object, because one is united
to it by a secret affinity, he experiences for the images
of this object a sentiment of sympathy. We could not
explain its origin, or assign its cause on any other
hypothesis, even were we to limit ourselves to the
consideration of physical love. Even this kind of love
is a desire to procreate <span class="locked">beauty,<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span> for it would be absurd
to insist that that Nature, which aspires to create
beautiful things, should aspire to procreate that which
is ugly.</p>

<h3>EARTHLY BEAUTY IS AN IMAGE OF INTELLIGIBLE
BEAUTY.</h3>

<p>Of course, those who, here below, desire to procreate
are satisfied in attaining that which is beautiful here
below: namely, the beauty which shines in images and
bodies; for they do not possess that intelligible Beauty
which, nevertheless, inspires them with that very love
which they bear to visible beauty. That is the reason
why those who ascend to the reminiscence of intelligible
Beauty love that which they behold here below
only because it is an image of the <span class="locked">other.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> As to those
who fail to rise to the reminiscence of the intelligible
Beauty, because they do not know the cause of their
passion, they mistake visible beauty for that veritable
Beauty, and they may even love it chastely, if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1124" id="Page_1124">1124</a></span>
be temperate: but to go as far as a carnal union is an
error, in any case. Hence, it happens that only he
who is inspired by a pure love for the beautiful really
loves beauty, whether or not he have aroused his
reminiscence of intelligible Beauty.</p>

<h3>BEAUTY IS IMMORTAL.</h3>

<p>They who join to this passion as much of a desire
for immortality as our mortal nature admits, seek
beauty in the perpetuity of the procreation which
renders man imperishable. They determine to procreate
and produce beauty according to nature; procreating
because their object is perpetuity; and procreating
beautifully because they possess affinity with
it. In fact, perpetuity does bear affinity to beauty;
perpetual nature is beauty itself; and such also are all
its derivatives.</p>

<h3>PASSIONAL LOVE MAY BE ELEVATING, THOUGH
OPEN TO MISLEADING TEMPTATIONS.</h3>

<p>Thus he who does not desire to procreate seems to
aspire to the possession of the beautiful in a higher
degree. He who desires to procreate does no doubt
desire to procreate the beautiful; but his desire indicates
in him the presence of need, and dissatisfaction
with mere possession of beauty; He thinks he will be
procreating beauty, if he begets on that which is beautiful.
They who wish to satisfy physical love against
human laws, and nature, no doubt have a natural inclination
as principle of a triple passion; but they lose
their way straying from the right road for lack of
knowledge of the end to which love was impelling
them, of the goal of the aspiration (roused by) the
desire of generation, and of the proper use of the
image of <span class="locked">beauty.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span> They really do ignore Beauty itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1125" id="Page_1125">1125</a></span>
They who love beautiful bodies without desiring to
unite themselves to them, love them for their beauty
only. Those who love the beauty of women, and
desire union with them, love both beauty and perpetuity,
so long as this object is not lost from sight.
Both of these are temperate, but they who love bodies
for their beauty only are the more virtuous. The
former admire sensual beauty, and are content therewith;
the latter recall intelligible beauty, but, without
scorning visible beauty, regard it as an effect and
image of the intelligible <span class="locked">Beauty.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> Both, therefore,
love beauty without ever needing to blush. But, as to
those (who violate laws human and divine), love of
beauty misleads them to falling into ugliness; for the
desire of good may often mislead to a fall into evil.
Such is love considered as a passion of the soul.</p>

<h3>THE PLATONIC MYTH OF LOVE.</h3>

<p>2. Now let us speak of the Love which is considered
a deity not only by men in general, but also
by the (Orphic) theologians, and by Plato. The latter
often speaks of Love, son of Venus, attributing to
him the mission of being the chief of the beautiful
children (or, boys); and to direct souls to the contemplation
of intelligible Beauty, or, if already present,
to intensify the instinct to seek it. In his "Banquet"
Plato says that Love is born (not of Venus, but) of
Abundance and <span class="locked">Need,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> ... on some birthday (?)
of Venus.</p>

<h3>INTERPRETATION OF THE PLATONIC MYTH.</h3>

<p>To explain if Love be born of Venus, or if he were
only born contemporaneously with his mother, we
shall have to study something about Venus. What is
Venus? Is she the mother of Love, or only his contemporary?
As answer hereto we shall observe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1126" id="Page_1126">1126</a></span>
there are two <span class="locked">Venuses.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span> The second (or Popular
Venus) is daughter of Jupiter and Dione, and she presides
over earthly marriages. The first Venus, the
celestial one, daughter of Uranus (by Plato, in his
Cratylus, interpreted to mean "contemplation of things
above"), has no mother, and does not preside over
marriages, for the reason that there are none in
heaven. The Celestial Venus, therefore, daughter of
<span class="locked">Kronos,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span> that is, of Intelligence, is the divine Soul,
which is born pure of pure Intelligence, and which
dwells <span class="locked">above.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> As her nature does not admit of inclining
earthward, she neither can nor will descend
here below. She is, therefore, a form of existence (or,
an hypostasis), separated from matter, not participating
in its nature. This is the significance of the allegory
that she had no mother. Rather than a guardian,
therefore, she should be considered a deity, as she is
pure Being unmingled (with matter), and abiding
within herself.</p>

<h3>LOVE, LIKE HIGHER SOUL, OR LIGHT, IS
INSEPARABLE FROM ITS SOURCE.</h3>

<p>In fact, that which is immediately born of Intelligence
is pure in itself, because, by its very proximity to
Intelligence, it has more innate force, desiring to unite
itself firmly to the principle that begat it, and which
can retain it there on high. The soul which is thus
suspended to Intelligence could not fall down, any
more than the light which shines around the sun could
separate from the body from which it radiates, and to
which it is attached.</p>

<h3>WHO CELESTIAL VENUS IS.</h3>

<p>Celestial Venus (the universal Soul, the third principle
or <span class="locked">hypostasis<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span>), therefore, attaches herself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1127" id="Page_1127">1127</a></span>
Kronos (divine Intelligence, the second principle), or,
if you prefer to Uranos (the One, the Good, the first
Principle), the father of Kronos. Thus Venus turns
towards Uranos, and unites herself to him; and in the
act of loving him, she procreates Love, with which she
contemplates Uranus. Her activity thus effects a
hypostasis and being. Both of them therefore fix
their gaze on Uranus, both the mother and the fair
child, whose nature it is to be a hypostasis ever turned
towards another beauty, an intermediary essence between
the lover and the beloved object. In fact, Love
is the eye by which the lover sees the beloved object;
anticipating her, so to speak; and before giving her
the faculty of seeing by the organ which he thus constitutes,
he himself is already full of the spectacle
offered to his contemplation. Though he thus anticipates
her, he does not contemplate the intelligible in
the same manner as she does, in that he offers her the
spectacle of the intelligible, and that he himself enjoys
the vision of the beautiful, a vision that passes by him
(or, that coruscates around him, as an aureole).</p>

<h3>LOVE POSSESSES DIVINE BEING.</h3>

<p>3. We are therefore forced to acknowledge that
Love is a hypostasis and is "being," which no doubt is
inferior to the Being from which it (emanates, that is,
from celestial Venus, or the celestial Soul), but which,
nevertheless, still possesses "being." In fact, that
celestial Soul is a being born of the activity which is
superior to her (the primary Being), a living Being,
emanating from the primary Being, and attached to
the contemplation thereof. In it she discovers the
first object of her contemplation, she fixes her glance
on it, as her good; and finds in this view a source of
joy. The seen object attracts her attention so that,
by the joy she feels, by the ardent attention characterizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1128" id="Page_1128">1128</a></span>
her contemplation of its object, she herself begets
something worthy of her and of the spectacle she enjoys.
Thus is Love born from the attention with which
the soul applies herself to the contemplation of its
object, and from the very emanation of this object;
and so Love is an eye full of the object it contemplates,
a vision united to the image which it forms.
Thus Love (Eros) seems to owe its name to its deriving
its existence from <span class="locked">vision.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span> Even when considered
as passion does Love owe its name to the same
fact, for Love-that-is-a-being is anterior to Love-that-is-not-a-being.
However much we may explain passion
as love, it is, nevertheless, ever the love of some
object, and is not love in an absolute sense.</p>

<h3>CELESTIAL LOVE MUST ABIDE IN THE INTELLIGIBLE
WITH THE CELESTIAL SOUL.</h3>

<p>Such is the love that characterizes the superior Soul
(the celestial Soul). It contemplates the intelligible
world with it, because Love is the Soul's companion,
being born of the Soul, and abiding in the Soul, and
with her enjoys contemplation of the divinities. Now
as we consider the Soul which first radiates its light on
heaven as separate from matter, we must admit that
the love which is connected with her, is likewise separate
from matter. If we say that this pure Soul really
resides in heaven, it is in the sense in which we say
that that which is most precious in us (the reasonable
soul) resides in our body, and, nevertheless, is separate
from matter. This love must, therefore, reside only
there where resides this pure Soul.</p>

<h3>THERE IS A LOWER LOVE, CORRESPONDING TO
THE WORLD-SOUL.</h3>

<p>But as it was similarly necessary that beneath the
celestial Soul there should exist the <span class="locked">world-Soul,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span> there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1129" id="Page_1129">1129</a></span>
must exist with it another love, born of her desire, and
being her <span class="locked">eye.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> As this Venus belongs to this world,
and as it is not the pure soul, nor soul in an absolute
sense, it has begotten the Love which reigns here
below, and which, with her, presides over marriages.
As far as this Love himself feels the desire for the
intelligible, he turns towards the intelligible the souls
of the young people, and he elevates the soul to which
he may be united, as far as it is naturally disposed to
have reminiscence of the intelligible. Every soul,
indeed, aspires to the Good, even that soul that is
mingled with matter, and that is the soul of some particular
being; for it is attached to the superior Soul,
and proceeds therefrom.</p>

<h3>ALL SOULS HAVE THEIR LOVE, WHICH IS THEIR
GUARDIAN.</h3>

<p>4. Does each soul include such a love in her being,
and possess it as a hypostatic (form of existence)?
Since the world-Soul possesses, as hypostasis (form
of existence), the Love which is inherent in her being,
our soul should also similarly possess, as hypostatic
(form of existence), a love equally inherent in our
being. Why should the same not obtain even with
animals? This love inherent to the being of every
soul is the guardian considered to be attached to each
<span class="locked">individual.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span> It inspires each soul with the desires
natural for her to experience; for, according to her
nature, each soul begets a love which harmonizes with
her dignity and being. As the universal Soul possesses
universal Love, so do individual souls each possess her
individual love. But as the individual souls are not
separated from the universal Soul, and are so contained
within her that their totality forms but a single
<span class="locked">soul,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span> so are individual loves contained within the
universal Love. On the other hand, each individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1130" id="Page_1130">1130</a></span>
love is united to an individual soul, as universal Love
is united to the universal Soul. The latter exists entire
everywhere in the universe, and so her unity seems
multiple; she appears anywhere in the universe that she
pleases, under the various forms suitable to her parts,
and she reveals herself, at will, under some visible form.</p>

<h3>THE HIGHER LOVE IS DEITY, THE LOWER IS A
GUARDIAN.</h3>

<p>We shall have to assume also a multiplicity of
Venuses, which, born with Love, occupy the rank of
guardians. They originate from the universal Venus,
from which derive all the individual "venuses," with
the loves peculiar to each. In fact, the soul is the
mother of love; now Venus is the Soul, and Love is
the Soul's activity in desiring the Good. The love
which leads each soul to the nature of the Good, and
which belongs to her most exalted part, must also be
considered a deity, inasmuch as it unites the soul to
the Good. The love which belongs to the soul mingled
(with matter), is to be considered a Guardian only.</p>

<h3>IT IS AN ERROR TO CONSIDER THE LOVE AS
IDENTICAL WITH THE WORLD.</h3>

<p>5. What is the nature of this Guardian, and what
is, in general, the nature of guardians, according to
(Plato's treatment of the subject in) his "Banquet"?
What is the nature of guardians? What is the nature
of the Love born of Need (Penia) and Abundance
(Poros), son of Prudence (Metis), at the birth of
Venus?<a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>(Plutarch)<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> held that Plato, by Love, meant the
world. He should have stated that Love is part of the
world, and was born in it. His opinion is erroneous,
as may be demonstrated by several proofs. First,
(Plato) calls the world a blessed deity, that is self-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1131" id="Page_1131">1131</a></span>sufficient;
however, he never attributes these characteristics
to Love, which he always calls a needy being.
Further, the world is composed of a body and a Soul,
the latter being Venus; consequently, Venus would be
the directing part of Love; or, if we take the world
to mean the world-Soul, just as we often say "man"
when we mean the human <span class="locked">soul,<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span> Love would be
identical with Venus. Third, if Love, which is a
Guardian, is the world, why should not the other
Guardians (who evidently are of the same nature)
not also be the world? In this case, the world would
be composed of Guardians. Fourth, how could we
apply to the world that which (Plato) says of Love,
that it is the "guardian of fair children"? Last, Plato
describes Love as lacking clothing, shoes, and lodging.
This could not be applied to the world without absurdity
or ridicule.</p>

<h3>ALL GUARDIANS ARE BORN OF NEED AND
ABUNDANCE.</h3>

<p>6. To explain the nature and birth of Love, we
shall have to expound the significance of his mother
Need to his father Abundance, and to show how such
parents suit him. We shall also have to show how
such parents suit the other Guardians, for all Guardians,
by virtue of their being Guardians, must have
the same nature, unless, indeed, Guardians have only
that name in common.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEITIES AND GUARDIANS.</h3>

<p>First, we shall have to consider the difference
between deities and guardians. Although it be common
to call Guardians deities, we are here using the
word in that sense it bears when one says that Guardians
and deities belong to different species. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1132" id="Page_1132">1132</a></span>
deities are impassible, while the Guardians, though
eternal, can experience passions; placed beneath the
deities, but next to us, they occupy the middle place
between deities and <span class="locked">men.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span></p>

<h3>A GUARDIAN IS THE VESTIGE OF A SOUL
DESCENDED INTO THE WORLD.</h3>

<p>But how did the Guardians not remain impassible?
How did they descend to an inferior nature? This
surely is a question deserving consideration. We
should also inquire whether there be any Guardian in
the intelligible world, whether there be Guardians only
here below, and if deities exist only in the intelligible
world. (We shall answer as follows.) There are
deities also here below; and the world is, as we
habitually say, a deity of the third rank, inasmuch as
every supra-lunar being is a divinity. Next, it would
be better not to call any being belonging to the intelligible
world a Guardian; and if we locate the chief
Guardian (the Guardian himself) in the intelligible
world, we had better consider him a deity. In the
world of sense, all the visible supra-lunar deities should
be called second-rank deities, in that they are placed
below the intelligible deities, and depend on them as
the rays of light from the star from which they radiate.
Last, a Guardian should be defined as the vestige of a
soul that had descended into the world. The latter
condition is necessary because every pure soul begets
a deity, and we have already <span class="locked">said<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> that the love of
such a soul is a deity.</p>

<h3>WHY ALL GUARDIANS ARE NOT LOVES.</h3>

<p>But why are not all the Guardians Loves? Further,
why are they not completely pure from all matter?
Among Guardians, those are Loves, which owe their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1133" id="Page_1133">1133</a></span>
existence to a soul's desire for the good and the beautiful;
therefore, all souls that have entered into this
world each generate a Love of this kind. As to the
other Guardians, which are not born of human souls,
they are engendered by the different powers of the
universal Soul, for the utility of the All; they complete
and administer all things for the general good.
The universal Soul, in fact, was bound to meet the
needs of the universe by begetting Guardian powers
which would suit the All of which she is the soul.</p>

<h3>WHY THE GUARDIANS ARE NOT FREE FROM
MATTER.</h3>

<p>How do Guardians participate in matter, and of
what matter are they formed? This their matter is
not corporeal, otherwise they would be animals with
sensation. In fact, whether they have aerial or fire-like
<span class="locked">bodies,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span> they must have had a nature primitively
different (from pure Intelligence) to have ultimately
united each with his own body, for that which
is entirely pure could not have immediately united
with a body, although many philosophers think that
the being of every Guardian, as guardian, is united
to an air-like or fire-like body. But why is the being
of every Guardian mingled with a body, while the
being of every deity is pure, unless in the first case
there be a cause which produces the mingling (with
matter)? This cause must be the existence of an
intelligible <span class="locked">matter,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> so that whatever participates in it
might, by its means, come to unite with sense-matter.</p>

<h3>SOUL IS A MIXTURE OF REASON AND
INDETERMINATION.</h3>

<p>7. Plato's account of the birth of <span class="locked">Love<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> is that
Abundance intoxicated himself with nectar, this happening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1134" id="Page_1134">1134</a></span>
before the day of wine, which implies that Love
was born before the sense-world's existence. Then
Need, the mother of Love, must have participated in
the intelligible nature itself, and not in a simple image
of the intelligible nature; she, therefore, approached
(the intelligible nature) and found herself to be a
mixture of form and indeterminateness (or, intelligible
matter).<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> The soul, in fact, containing a certain
indeterminateness before she had reached the Good,
but feeling a premonition of her existence, formed for
herself a confused and indeterminate image, which
became the very hypostasis (or, form of existence)
of Love. Thus, as here, reason mingles with the unreasonable,
with an indeterminate desire, with an
indistinct (faint or obscure) hypostatic (form of existence).
What was born was neither perfect nor complete;
it was something needy, because it was born
from an indeterminate desire, and a complete reason.
As to (Love, which is) the thus begotten reason, it is
not pure, since it contains a desire that is indeterminate,
unreasonable, indefinite; nor will it ever be satisfied
so long as it contains the nature of indetermination.
It depends on the soul, which is its generating principle;
it is a mixture effected by a reason which, instead
of remaining within itself, is mingled with indetermination.
Besides, it is not Reason itself, but its emanation
which mingles with indetermination.</p>

<h3>LOVE IS A GADFLY.</h3>

<p>Love, therefore, is similar to a <span class="locked">gad-fly;<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> needy by
nature, it still remains needy, whatever it may obtain;
it could never be satisfied, for this would be impossible
for a being that is a mixture; no being could ever be
fully satisfied if by its nature it be incapable of attaining
fulness; even were it satisfied for a moment, it
could not retain anything if its nature made it continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1135" id="Page_1135">1135</a></span>
to desire. Consequently, on one side, Love is deprived
of all <span class="locked">resources<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span> because of its neediness; and on the
other, it possesses the faculty of acquisition, because
of the reason that enters into its constitution.</p>

<h3>GUARDIANS, AS WELL AS MEN, ARE URGED BY
DIVINE DISCONTENT.</h3>

<p>All other Guardians have a similar constitution.
Each of them desires, and causes the acquisition of the
good he is destined to procure; that is the characteristic
they have in common with Love. Neither could
they ever attain satisfaction; they still desire some particular
good. The result of this is that the men who
here below are good are inspired by the love of the
true, absolute Good, and not by the love of such and
such a particular <span class="locked">good.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> Those who are subordinated
to divers Guardians are successively subordinated to
such or such a Guardian; they let the simple and pure
love of the absolute Good rest within themselves,
while they see to it that their actions are presided over
by another Guardian, that is, another power of their
soul, which is immediately superior to that which
directs them, or is active within <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span> As to the
men who, driven by evil impulses, desire evil things,
they seem to have chained down all the loves in their
souls, just as, by false opinions, they darken the right
reason which is innate within them. Thus all the loves
implanted in us by nature, and which conform to
nature, are all good; those that belong to the inferior
part of the soul are inferior in rank and power; those
that belong to the superior part are superior; all belong
to the being of the soul. As to the loves which are
contrary to nature, they are the passions of strayed
souls, having nothing essential or substantial; for they
are not engendered by the pure Soul; they are the
fruits of the faults of the soul which produces them
according to her vicious habits and dispositions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1136" id="Page_1136">1136</a></span></p>

<h3>RIGHT THOUGHTS POSSESS REAL EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>In general, we might admit that the true goods
which are possessed by the soul when she acts conformably
to her nature, by applying herself to things
determined (by reason), constitute real being; that the
others, on the contrary, are not engendered by the
very action of the soul, and are only <span class="locked">passions.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> Likewise,
false intellections lack real being, such as belongs
to true intellections, which are eternal and determinate,
possessing simultaneously the intellectual act, the intelligible
existence and essence; and this latter not
only in general, but in each real intelligible being
(manifesting?) Intelligence in each idea. As to us,
we must acknowledge that we possess only intellection
and the intelligible; we do not possess them together
(or completely), but only in general; and hence comes
our love for generalities. Our conceptions, indeed,
usually trend towards the general. It is only by accident
that we conceive something particular; when,
for instance, we conceive that some particular triangle's
angles amount to two right angles, it is only as a result
of first having conceived that the triangle in general
possesses this property.</p>

<h3>JUPITER, THE GREAT CHIEF, OR THIRD GOD, IS THE
SOUL, OR VENUS.</h3>

<p>8. Finally, who is this Jupiter into whose gardens
(Plato said that) Abundance entered? What are these
gardens? As we have already agreed, Venus is the
Soul, and Abundance is the Reason of all things. We
still have to explain the significance of Jupiter and his
gardens.</p>

<p>Jupiter cannot well signify anything else than the
soul, since we have already admitted that the soul was
Venus. We must here consider Jupiter as that deity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1137" id="Page_1137">1137</a></span>
which Plato, in his Phaedrus, calls the Great <span class="locked">Chief;<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span>
and, elsewhere, as I think, the Third God. He explains
himself more clearly in this respect in the <span class="locked">Philebus,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span>
where he says that Jupiter "has a royal soul, a
royal intelligence." Since Jupiter is, therefore, both
an intelligence and a soul, since he forms part of the
order of causes, since we must assign him his rank
according to what is best in him; and for several
reasons, chiefly because he is a cause, a royal and
directing cause, he must be considered as the Intelligence.
Venus (that is, Aphrodite) which belongs to
him, which proceeds from him, and accompanies him,
occupies the rank of a soul, for she represents in the
soul that which is beautiful, brilliant, pure, and delicate
("abron"); and that is why she is called <span class="locked">"Aphrodite."<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span>
In fact, if we refer the male deities to the
intellect, and if we consider the female deities as souls&mdash;because
a soul is attached to each intelligence&mdash;we
shall have one more reason to relate Venus to Jupiter.
Our views upon this point are confirmed by the teachings
of the priests and the (Orphic) Theologians, who
always identify Venus and Juno, and who call the
evening star, or Star of Venus, the Star of <span class="locked">Juno.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span></p>

<h3>JUPITER'S GARDEN IS THE FRUITFUL REASON
THAT BEGETS EVERY OBJECT.</h3>

<p>9. Abundance, being the reason of the things that
exist in Intelligence and in the intelligible world&mdash;I
mean the reason which pours itself out and develops&mdash;trends
towards the soul, and exists therein. Indeed, the
(Being) which remains united in Intelligence does not
emanate from a foreign principle, while the intoxication
of Abundance is only a factitious fulness. But
what is that which is intoxicated with nectar? It is
Reason that descends from the superior principle to
the inferior; the Soul receives it from Intelligence at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1138" id="Page_1138">1138</a></span>
the moment of the birth of Venus; that is why it is
said that the nectar flows in the garden of Jupiter.
This whole garden is the glory and splendor of the
wealth (of Intelligence);<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> this glory originates in the
reason of Jupiter; this splendor is the light which the
intelligence of this Deity sheds on the soul. What else
but the beauties and splendors of this deity could the
"gardens of Jupiter" signify? On the other hand,
what else can the beauties and splendors of Jupiter be,
if not the reasons<a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> that emanate from him? At the
same time, these reasons are called Abundance (Poros,
or "euporia"), the wealth of the beauties which manifest;
that is the nectar which intoxicates <span class="locked">Abundance.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span>
For indeed what else is the nectar among the deities,
but that which each of them receives? Now Reason
is that which is received from Intelligence by its next
inferior principle. Intelligence possesses itself fully;
yet this self-possession does not intoxicate it, as it possesses
nothing foreign thereto. On the contrary,
Reason is engendered by Intelligence. As it exists
beneath Intelligence, and does not, as Intelligence does,
belong to itself, it exists in another principle; consequently,
we say that Abundance is lying down in the
garden of Jupiter, and that at the very moment when
Venus, being born, takes her place among living
beings.</p>

<h3>THE OBJECT OF MYTHS IS TO ANALYSE; AND TO
DISTINGUISH.</h3>

<p>10. If myths are to earn their name (of something
"reserved," or "silent") they must necessarily
develop their stories under the category of time, and
present as separate many things, that are simultaneous,
though different in rank or power. That is the reason
they so often mention the generation of ungenerated
things, and that they so often separate simultaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1139" id="Page_1139">1139</a></span>
<span class="locked">things.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> But after having thus (by this analysis)
yielded us all the instruction possible to them, these
myths leave it to the reader to make a synthesis thereof.
Ours is the following:</p>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PLATONIC MYTH OF THE
GARDEN OF JUPITER.</h3>

<p>Venus is the Soul which coexists with Intelligence,
and subsists by Intelligence. She receives from Intelligence
the <span class="locked">reasons<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span> which fill <span class="locked">her,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span> and embellishes
her, and whose abundance makes us see in the Soul
the splendor and image of all beauties. The reasons
which subsist in the Soul are <span class="locked">Abundance<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span> of the nectar
which flows down from above. Their splendors which
shine in the Soul, as in life, represent the Garden of
Jupiter. Abundance falls asleep in this garden, because
he is weighted down by the fulness contained
within him. As life manifests and ever exists in the
order of beings, (Plato) says that the deities are
seated at a feast, because they ever enjoy this beatitude.</p>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PLATONIC MYTH OF THE
BIRTH OF LOVE.</h3>

<p>Since the Soul herself exists, Love also must necessarily
exist, and it owes its existence to the desire of
the Soul which aspires to the better and the Good.
Love is a mixed being: it participates in need, because
it needs satisfaction; it also participates in abundance,
because it struggles to acquire good which it yet lacks,
inasmuch as only that which lacked good entirely
would cease to seek it. It is, therefore, correct to call
Love the son of Abundance and Need, which are constituted
by lack, desire, and reminiscence of the reasons&mdash;or
ideas&mdash;which, reunited in the soul, have therein
engendered that aspiration towards the good which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1140" id="Page_1140">1140</a></span>
constitutes love. Its mother is Need, because desire
belongs only to need, and "need" signifies matter,
which is entire <span class="locked">need.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> Even indetermination, which
characterizes the desire of the good, makes the being
which desires the Good play the part of matter&mdash;since
such a being would have neither form nor reason, considered
only from its desiring. It is a form only inasmuch
as it remains within itself. As soon as it desires
to attain a new perfection, it is matter relatively to
the being from whom it desires to receive somewhat.</p>

<h3>LOVE IS BOTH MATERIAL AND A GUARDIAN.</h3>

<p>That is why Love is both a being which participates
in matter, and is also a Guardian born of the soul; it
is the former, inasmuch as it does not completely
possess the good; it is the latter, inasmuch as it desires
the Good from the very moment of its birth.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS TO BE DISCUSSED.</h3>

<p>1. Studying the origin of evils that might affect
all beings in general, or some one class in particular, it
is reasonable to begin by defining evil, from a consideration
of its nature. That would be the best way to discover
whence it arises, where it resides, to whom it may
happen, and in general to decide if it be something real.
Which one of our faculties then can inform us of the
nature of evil? This question is not easy to solve,
because there must be an analogy between the knower
and the <span class="locked">known.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span> The Intelligence and the Soul may
indeed cognize forms and fix their desires on them,
because they themselves are forms; but evil, which consists
in the absence of all goods, could not be described
as a <span class="locked">form.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span> But inasmuch as there can be but one
single science, to embrace even contraries, and as the
evil is the contrary of the good, knowledge of the good
implies that of evil. Therefore, to determine the nature
of evil, we shall first have to determine that of good,
for the higher things must precede the lower, as some
are forms and others are not, being rather a privation of
the good. Just in what sense evil is the contrary of the
good must also be determined; as for instance, if the
One be the first, and matter the <span class="locked">last;<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span> or whether the
One be form, and matter be its absence. Of this
further.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1143" id="Page_1143">1143</a></span><a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<h3 class="large">A. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EVIL.</h3>

<h3>A DEFINITION OF EVIL BY CONTRAST WITH THE
GOOD.</h3>

<p>2. Let us now determine the nature of the Good,
at least so far as is demanded by the present discussion.
The Good is the principle on which all depends, to
which everything aspires, from which everything issues,
and of which everything has need. As to Him, He
suffices to himself, being complete, so He stands in
need of nothing; He is the <span class="locked">measure<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span> and the end of all
things; and from Him spring intelligence, being, soul,
life, and intellectual contemplation.</p>

<h3>NATURE OF DIVINE INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>All these beautiful things exist as far as He does; but
He is the one Principle that possesses supreme beauty,
a principle that is superior to the things that are best.
He reigns <span class="locked">royally,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span> in the intelligible world, being Intelligence
itself, very differently from what we call
human intelligences. The latter indeed are all occupied
with propositions, discussions about the meanings
of words, reasonings, examinations of the validity
of conclusions, observing the concatenation of causes,
being incapable of possessing truth "a priori," and
though they be intelligences, being devoid of all ideas
before having been instructed by experience; though
they, nevertheless, were intelligences. Such is not the
primary Intelligence. On the contrary, it possesses all
things. Though remaining within itself, it is all things;
it possesses all things, without possessing them (in the
usual acceptation of that term); the things that subsist
in it not differing from it, and not being separated
from each other. Each one of them is all the <span class="locked">others,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span>
is everything and everywhere, although not confounded
with other things, and remaining distinct therefrom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1144" id="Page_1144">1144</a></span></p>

<h3>NATURE OF THE UNIVERSAL SOUL.</h3>

<p>The power which participates in Intelligence (the
universal Soul) does not participate in it in a manner
such as to be equal to it, but only in the measure of
her ability to participate therein. She is the first actualization
of Intelligence, the first being that Intelligence,
though remaining within itself, begets. She directs her
whole activity towards supreme Intelligence, and lives
exclusively thereby. Moving from outside Intelligence,
and around it, according to the laws of harmony,<a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> the
universal Soul fixes her glance upon it. By contemplation
penetrating into its inmost depths, through Intelligence
she sees the divinity Himself. Such is the
nature of the serene and blissful existence of the
divinities, a life where evil has no place.</p>

<h3>EVIL EXISTS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DERIVATIVE
GOODS OF THE THIRD RANK.</h3>

<p>If everything stopped there (and if there were
nothing beyond the three principles here described),
evil would not exist (and there would be nothing but
goods). But there are goods of the first, second and
third ranks. Though all relate to the King of all
things,<a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> who is their author, and from whom they
derive their goodness, yet the goods of the second rank
relate more specially to the second principle; and to
the third principle, the goods of the third rank.</p>

<h3>NATURE OF EVIL.</h3>

<p>3. As these are real beings, and as the first Principle
is their superior, evil could not exist in such
beings, and still less in Him, who is superior to them;
for all these things are good. Evil then must be
located in non-being, and must, so to speak, be its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1145" id="Page_1145">1145</a></span>
form, referring to the things that mingle with it, or
have some community with it. This "non-being,"
however, is not absolute <span class="locked">non-being.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> Its difference
from being resembles the difference between being and
movement or rest; but only as its image, or something
still more distant from reality. Within this non-being
are comprised all sense-objects, and all their passive
modifications; or, evil may be something still more inferior,
like their accident or principle, or one of the
things that contribute to its constitution. To gain some
conception of evil it may be represented by the contrast
between measure and incommensurability; between indetermination
and its goal; between lack of form and
the creating principle of form; between lack and self-sufficiency;
as the perpetual unlimited and changeableness;
as passivity, insatiableness, and absolute <span class="locked">poverty.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span>
Those are not the mere accidents of evil, but
its very essence; all of that can be discovered when
any part of evil is examined. The other objects, when
they participate in the evil and resemble it, become
evil without however being absolute Evil.</p>

<h3>EVIL POSSESSES A LOWER FORM OF BEING.</h3>

<p>All these things participate in a being; they do not
differ from it, they are identical with it, and constitute
it. For if evil be an accident in something, then evil,
though not being a real being, must be something by
itself. Just as, for the good, there is the Good in itself,
and the good considered as an attribute of a foreign
subject, likewise, for evil, one may distinguish Evil in
itself, and evil as accident.</p>

<h3>EVIL AS INFINITE AND FORMLESSNESS IN ITSELF.</h3>

<p>It might be objected that it is impossible to conceive
of indetermination outside of the indeterminate, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1146" id="Page_1146">1146</a></span>
more than determination outside of the determinate; or
measure outside of the measured. (We shall have to
answer that) just as determination does not reside in
the determined (or measure in the measured), so indetermination
cannot exist within the indeterminate.
If it can exist in something other than itself, it will be
either in the indeterminate, or in the determinate. If
in the indeterminate, it is evident that it itself is indeterminate,
and needs no indetermination to become
such. If, on the other hand (it be claimed that indetermination
exist), in the determinate, (it is evident
that) the determinate cannot admit indetermination.
This, therefore, demands the existence of something
infinite in itself, and formless in itself, which would
combine all the characteristics mentioned above as the
characteristics of <span class="locked">evil.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span> As to evil things, they are
such because evil is mingled with them, either because
they contemplate evil, or because they fulfil it.</p>

<h3>THE PRIMARY EVIL IS EVIL IN ITSELF.</h3>

<p>Reason, therefore, forces us to recognize as the
primary evil, Evil in <span class="locked">itself.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span> (This is matter which is)
the subject of figure, form, determination, and limitation;
which owes its ornaments to others, which has
nothing good in itself, which is but a vain image by
comparison with the real beings&mdash;in other word, the
essence of evil, if such an essence can exist.</p>

<h3>MATTER AS THE SECONDARY EVIL.</h3>

<p>4. So far as the nature of bodies participates in
matter, it is an evil; yet it could not be the primary
Evil, for it has a certain form. Nevertheless, this form
possesses no reality, and is, besides, deprived of
life (?); for bodies corrupt each other mutually. Being
agitated by an unregulated movement, they hinder the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1147" id="Page_1147">1147</a></span>
soul from carrying out her proper movement. They
are in a perpetual flux, contrary to the immutable
nature of essences; therefore, they constitute the
secondary evil.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL IS NOT EVIL BY HERSELF, BUT MAY
DEGENERATE BY LOOKING AT DARKNESS.</h3>

<p>By herself, the soul is not evil, and not every soul is
evil. What soul deserves to be so considered? That
of the man who, according to the expression of <span class="locked">Plato,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span>
is a slave to the body. In this man it is natural for the
soul to be evil. It is indeed the irrational part of the
soul which harbors all that constitutes evil: indetermination,
excess, and need, from which are derived intemperance,
cowardliness, and all the vices of the soul, the
involuntary passions, mothers of false opinions, which
lead us to consider the things we seek or avoid as goods
or evils. But what produces this evil? How shall we
make a cause or a principle of it? To begin with, the
soul is neither independent of matter, nor, by herself,
perverse. By virtue of her union with the body, which
is material, she is mingled with indetermination, and
so, to a certain point, deprived of the form which embellishes
and which supplies measure. Further, that
reason should be hindered in its operations, and cannot
see well, must be due to the soul's being hindered by
passions, and obscured by the darkness with which
matter surrounds her. The soul <span class="locked">inclines<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> towards
matter. Thus the soul fixes her glance, not on what is
essence, but on what is simple <span class="locked">generation.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span> Now the
principle of generation is matter, whose nature is so
bad that matter communicates it to the beings which,
even without being united thereto, merely look at it.
Being the privation of good, matter contains none of it,
and assimilates to itself all that touches it. Therefore,
the perfect Soul, being turned towards ever pure Intelligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1148" id="Page_1148">1148</a></span>
repels matter, indeterminateness, the lack of
measure, and in short, evil. The perfect Soul does not
approach to it, does not lower her looks; she remains
pure and determined by Intelligence. The soul which
does not remain in this state, and which issues from
herself (to unite with the body), not being determined
by the First, the Perfect, is no more than an image of
the perfect Soul because she lacks (good), and is filled
with indetermination. The soul sees nothing but darkness.
The soul already contains matter because she
looks at what she cannot see; or, in the every-day
expression, because the soul looks at <span class="locked">darkness.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span></p>

<h3>PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EVIL FOR THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>5. Since the lack of good is the cause that the soul
looks at darkness, and mingles therewith, the lack of
good and darkness is primary Evil for the soul. The
secondary evil will be the darkness, and the nature of
evil, considered not in matter, but before matter. Evil
consists not in the lack of any particular thing, but
of everything in general. Nothing is evil merely because
it lacks a little of being good; its nature might
still be perfect. But what, like matter, lacks good
entirely, is essentially evil, and possesses nothing good?
Nature, indeed, does not possess essence, or it would
participate in the good; only by verbal similarity can
we say that matter "is," while we can truly say that
matter "is" absolute "nonentity." A mere lack (of
good) therefore, may be characterized as not being
good; but complete lack is evil; while a lack of medium
intensity consists in the possibility of falling into evil,
and is already an evil. Evil, therefore, is not any particular
evil, as injustice, or any special vice; evil is that
which is not yet anything of that, being nothing definite.
Injustice and the other vices must be considered as
kinds of evil, distinguished from each other by mere accidents;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1149" id="Page_1149">1149</a></span>
as for instance, what occurs by malice. Besides,
the different kinds of evil differ among each other
either by the matter in which evil resides, or by the
parts of the soul to which it refers, as sight, desire, and
passion.</p>

<h3>RELATION BETWEEN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL
EVIL.</h3>

<p>If we grant the existence of evils external to the soul,
we shall be forced to decide about their relation to
sickness, ugliness, or poverty. Sickness has been explained
as a lack or excess of material bodies which
fail to support order or measure. The cause of ugliness,
also, has been given as deficient adjustment of
matter to form. Poverty has been described as the
need or lack of objects necessary to life as a result of
our union with matter, whose nature is (the Heraclitian
and Stoic) "indigence." From such definitions
it would follow that we are not the principle of evil,
and are not evil in ourselves, for these evils existed
before us. Only in spite of themselves would men
yield to vice. The evils of the soul are avoidable, but
not all men possess the necessary firmness. Evil,
therefore, is caused by the presence of matter in sense-objects,
and is not identical with the wickedness of men.
For wickedness does not exist in all men; some triumph
over wickedness, while they who do not even need to
triumph over it, are still better. In all cases men
triumph over evil by those of their faculties that are
not engaged in matter.</p>

<h3>IN WHAT SENSE EVILS ARE UNIVERSAL AND
UNAVOIDABLE.</h3>

<p>6. Let us examine the significance of the <span class="locked">doctrine<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span>
that evils cannot be destroyed, that they are necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1150" id="Page_1150">1150</a></span>
that they do not exist among the divinities, but that
they ever besiege our mortal nature, and the place in
which we <span class="locked">dwell.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span> Surely heaven is free from all evil
because it moves eternally with regularity, in perfect
order; because in the stars is neither injustice nor any
other kind of evil, because they do not conflict with
each other in their courses; and because their revolutions
are presided over by the most beautiful <span class="locked">harmony.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span>
On the contrary, the earth reveals injustice and disorder,
(chiefly) because our nature is mortal, and
we dwell in a lower place. But when Plato,<a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> says, that
we must flee from here below, he does not mean that
we should leave the earth, but, while remaining therein,
practice justice, piety, and wisdom. It is wickedness
that must be fled from, because wickedness and its consequences
are the evil of man.</p>

<h3>EVIL IS NOT GOOD'S QUALITATIVE, BUT ONLY
FIGURATIVE ANTAGONIST.</h3>

<p>When<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> (Theodor) tells (Socrates) that evils would
be annihilated if men practised (Socrates') teachings,
the latter answers that that is impossible, for evil is
necessary even if only as the contrary of good. But
how then can wickedness, which is the evil of man, be
the contrary of good? Because it is the contrary of
virtue. Now virtue, without being Good in itself, is
still a good, a good which makes us dominate matter.
But how can Good in itself, which is not a quality, have
a contrary? Besides, why need the existence of one
thing imply its contrary? Though we may grant that
there is a possibility of the existence of the contrary
of some things&mdash;as for instance, that a man in good
health might become sick&mdash;there is no such necessity.
Nor does Plato assert that the existence of each thing
of this kind necessarily implies that of its contrary; he
makes this statement exclusively of the Good. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1151" id="Page_1151">1151</a></span>
how can there be a contrary to good, if the good be
"being," let alone "above being"?<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> Evidently, in
reference to particular beings, there can be nothing contrary
to "being." This is proved by induction; but the
proposition has not been demonstrated as regards universal
Being. What then is the contrary of universal
Being, and first principles in general? The contrary of
"being" must be nonentity; the contrary of the nature
of the Good is the nature and principle of Evil. These
two natures are indeed respectively the principles of
goods and of evils. All their elements are mutually
opposed, so that both these natures, considered in their
totality, are still more opposed than the other contraries.
The latter, indeed, belong to the same form,
to the same kind, and they have something in common
in whatever subjects they may be. As to the Contraries
that are essentially distinguished from each other, whose
nature is constituted of elements opposed to the constitutive
elements of the other, those Contraries are
absolutely opposed to each other, since the connotation
of that word implies things as opposite to each other
as possible. Measure, determination, and the other
characteristics of the divine <span class="locked">nature<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span> are the opposites
of incommensurability, indefiniteness, and the other
contrary things that constitute the nature of evil. Each
one of these wholes, therefore, is the contrary of the
other. The being of the one is that which is essentially
and absolutely false; that of the other is genuine Being;
the falseness of the one is, therefore, the contrary of
the truth of the other. Likewise what pertains to the
being of the one is the contrary of what belongs to the
being of the other. We also see that it is not always
true to say that there is no contrary to "being," for
we acknowledge that water and fire are contraries, even
if they did not contain the common element of matter,
of which heat and cold, humidity and dryness, are accidents.
If they existed alone by themselves, if their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1152" id="Page_1152">1152</a></span>
being were complete without any common subject,
there would still be an opposition, and an opposition of
"being." Therefore the things that are completely
separate, which have nothing in common, which are as
distant as possible, are by nature contrary. This is not
an opposition of quality, nor of any kinds of beings; it
is an opposition resulting from extreme distance, and
from being composed of contraries, thereby communicating
this characteristic to their elements.</p>

<h3>GOOD IMPLIES EVIL BECAUSE MATTER IS
NECESSARY TO THE WORLD.</h3>

<p>7. Why is the existence of both good and evil
necessary? Because matter is necessary to the existence
of the world. The latter is necessarily composed
of contraries, and, consequently, it could not exist without
matter. In this case the nature of this world is a
mixture of intelligence and <span class="locked">necessity.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span> What it receives
from divinity are goods; its evils derive from
the primordial <span class="locked">nature,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span> the term used (by Plato) to
designate matter as a simple substance yet unadorned
by a divinity. But what does he mean by "mortal
nature?" When he says that "evils besiege this region
here below," he means the universe, as appears from
the following <span class="locked">quotations<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span>: "Since you are born, you
are not immortal, but by my help you shall not perish."
In this case it is right to say that evils cannot be annihilated.
How then can one flee from them?<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> Not
by changing one's locality, (as Plato) says, but by
acquiring virtue, and by separating from the body,
which, simultaneously, is separation from matter; for
being attached to the body is also attachment to matter.
It is in the same sense that (Plato) explains being
separated from the body, or not being separated from
it. By dwelling with the divinities he means being
united to the intelligible objects; for it is in them that
inheres immortality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1153" id="Page_1153">1153</a></span></p>

<h3>EXISTENCE OF EVIL IS NECESSARY AS LAST
MATERIAL DEGREE OF BEING.</h3>

<p>Here follows still another demonstration of the
necessity of evil. Since good does not remain alone,
evil must necessarily exist by issuing from the <span class="locked">good.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span>
We might express this differently, as the degradation
and exhaustion (of the divine power, which, in the
whole hierarchic series of successive emanations weakens
from degree to degree). There must, therefore, be
a last degree of being, beyond which nothing further
can be begotten, and that is evil. Just as the existence
of something after a first (Good) is necessary, so must
also a last degree (of being) be necessary. Now the
last degree is matter, and contains nothing more of the
First; (and, as matter and evil are identical,) the existence
of evil is necessary.</p>

<h3>MATTER IS CAUSE OF EVIL, EVEN IF CORPOREAL.</h3>

<p>8. It may still be objected that it is not matter that
makes us wicked; for it is not matter that produces
ignorance and perverted appetites. If, indeed, these
appetites mislead us to evil as a result of the perversity
of the body, we must seek its cause, not in matter, but
in form (in the qualities of the bodies). These, for
instance, are heat, cold, bitterness, pungency, and the
other qualities of the bodily secretions; or, the atonic
condition or inflammation of certain organs; or, certain
dispositions which produce the difference of appetites;
and, if you please, false opinions. Evil, therefore, is
form rather than matter. Even under this (mistaken)
hypothesis we are none the less driven to acknowledge
that matter is the evil. A quality does not always produce
the same results within or outside of matter; thus
the form of the axe without iron does not cut. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1154" id="Page_1154">1154</a></span>
forms that inhere in matter are not always what they
would be if they were outside of it. The ("seminal)
reasons" when inhering in matter are by it corrupted
and filled with its nature. As fire, when separate from
matter, does not burn; so form, when remaining by
itself, effects what it would if it were in matter. Matter
dominates any principle that appears within it, alters it,
and corrupts it by imparting thereto its own nature,
which is contrary to the Good. It does not indeed
substitute cold for heat, but it adds to the form&mdash;as,
for instance, to the form of fire&mdash;its formless substance;
to figure adding its shapelessness; to measure,
its excess and lack, proceeding thus until it has degraded
things, transubstantiating them into its own
nature. That is the reason that, in the nutrition of
animals, what has been ingested does not remain what
it was before. The foods that enter into the body of a
dog, for instance, are by assimilation transformed into
blood and canine secretions, and, in general, are transformed
according to the animal that receives them.
Thus even under the hypothesis that evils are referred
to the body, matter is the cause of evils.</p>

<h3>MASTERY OF THESE CORPOREAL DISPOSITIONS IS
NOT EASY.</h3>

<p>It may be objected that one ought to master these
dispositions of the body. But the principle that could
triumph over them is pure only if it flee from here
below. The appetites which exercise the greatest force
come from a certain complexion of the body, and differ
according to its nature. Consequently, it is not easy to
master them. There are men who have no judgment,
because they are cold and heavy on account of their
bad constitution. On the contrary, there are others
who, because of their temperament, are light and inconstant.
This is proved by the difference of our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1155" id="Page_1155">1155</a></span>
successive dispositions. When we are gorged, we have
appetites and thoughts that differ from those we experience
when starved; and our dispositions vary even
according to the degrees of satiety.</p>

<h3>DEFINITION OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EVIL.</h3>

<p>In short, the primary Evil is that which by itself lacks
measure. The secondary evil is that which accidentally
becomes formless, either by assimilation or participation.
In the front rank is the darkness; in the second
that which has become obscured. Thus vice, being in
the soul the result of ignorance and formlessness, is of
secondary rank. It is not absolute Evil, because, on its
side, virtue is not absolute Good; it is good only by its
assimilation and participation with the Good.</p>

<h3 class="large">B. BY WHAT PART OF OUR NATURE WE
COME TO KNOW EVIL.</h3>

<h3>HOW THE SOUL COMES TO KNOW <span class="locked">VICE.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span></h3>

<p>9. How do we get to know vice and virtue? As
to virtue, we know it by the very intelligence and by
wisdom; for wisdom knows itself. But how can we
know vice? Just as we observe that an object is not
in itself straight, by applying a rule, so we discern vice
by this characteristic, that it does not comport itself
with virtue. But do we, or do we not have direct intuition
thereof? We do not have the intuition of absolute
vice, because it is indeterminate. We know it,
therefore, by a kind of abstraction, observing that
virtue is entirely lacking. We cognize relative vice by
noticing that it lacks some part of virtue. We see a
part of virtue, and, by this part, judging what is lacking
in order completely to constitute the form (of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1156" id="Page_1156">1156</a></span>
virtue), we call vice what is lacking to it; defining as
the indeterminate (evil) what is deprived of virtue.
Similarly with matter. If, for instance, we notice a
figure that is ugly because its ("seminal) reason," being
unable to dominate matter, has been unable to hide its
deformity, we notice ugliness by what is lacking to
form.</p>

<h3>HOW TO SEE MATTER: BY DIALECTIC ABSTRACTION.</h3>

<p>But how do we know that which is absolutely formless
(matter)? We make abstraction of all kinds of
form, and what remains we call matter. We allow
ourselves to be penetrated by a kind of shapelessness
by the mere fact that we make abstraction of all shape
in order to be able to represent matter (by a "bastard
reasoning").<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> Consequently, intelligence becomes
altered, and ceases to be genuine intelligence when it
dares in this way to look at what does not belong to its
<span class="locked">domain.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span> It resembles the eye, which withdraws from
light to see darkness, and which on that very account
does not see. Thus, in not seeing, the eye sees darkness
so far as it is naturally capable of seeing it. Thus
intelligence which hides light within itself, and which,
so to speak, issues from itself, by advancing towards
things alien to its nature, without bringing along its
own light, places itself in a state contrary to its being
to cognize a nature contrary to its <span class="locked">own.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span> But enough
of this.</p>

<h3>MATTER IS BOTH WITHOUT QUALITIES AND EVIL.</h3>

<p>10. It may well be asked (by Stoics) how matter
can be evil, as it is without quality?<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> That matter
possesses no qualities can be said in the sense that by
itself it has none of the qualities it is to receive, or to
which matter is to serve as substrate; but cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1157" id="Page_1157">1157</a></span>
said in the sense that it will possess no nature. Now,
if it have a nature, what hinders this nature from being
bad, without this being bad being a quality? Nothing
indeed is a quality but what serves to qualify something
different from itself; a quality is, therefore, an
accident; a quality is that which can be mentioned as
the attribute of a subject other than <span class="locked">itself.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span> But
matter is not the attribute of something alien; it is the
subject to which accidents are related. Therefore, since
every quality is an accident, matter, whose nature is not
to be an accident, is without <span class="locked">quality.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span> If, besides,
quality (taken in general), itself be without quality,
how could one say of matter, so far as it has not yet
received any quality, that it is in some manner qualified?
It is, therefore, possible to assert of matter that,
it both has no quality, and yet is evil. Matter is not
evil because it has a quality, but just because it has
none. If, indeed, matter possessed a form, it might
indeed be bad; but it would not be a nature contrary
to all form.</p>

<h3>MATTER AS DEPRIVATION IS STILL WITHOUT
QUALITIES.</h3>

<p>11. It may be further objected that nature, independent
of all form, is deprivation. Now deprivation
is always the attribute of some hypostatic substance,
instead of itself being substance. If then evil consist
in privation, it is the attribute of the substrate deprived
of form; and on that account it could not exist by
itself. If it be in the soul that we consider evil, privation
in the soul will constitute vice and wickedness, and
there will be no need to have recourse to anything
external to explain it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1158" id="Page_1158">1158</a></span></p>

<h3>MATTER MAY EXIST AND YET BE EVIL.</h3>

<p>Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> it is objected that matter does not exist;
here the attempt is to show that matter is not evil in
so far as it exists. (If this were the case), we should
not seek the origin of evil outside of the soul, but it
would be located within the soul herself; there evil
consists in the absence of good. But, evidently, the
soul would have nothing good on the hypothesis that
privation of form is an accident of the being, which
desires to receive form; that, consequently, the privation
of good is an accident of the soul; and that the
latter produces within herself wickedness by her
("seminal) reason." Another result would be that the
soul would have no life, and be inanimate; which
would lead to the absurdity that the soul is no soul.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL CANNOT POSSESS EVIL WITHIN HERSELF.</h3>

<p>We are thus forced to assert, that the soul possesses
life by virtue of her ("seminal) reason," so that she
does not, by herself, possess privation of good. Then
she must from intelligence derive a trace of good, and
have the form of good. The soul, therefore, cannot
by herself be evil. Consequently, she is not the first
Evil, nor does she contain it as an accident, since she
is not absolutely deprived of good.</p>

<h3>RELATIVE PRIVATION IS IMPOSSIBLE.</h3>

<p>12. To the objection that in the soul wickedness
and evil are not an absolute privation, but only a relative
privation of good, it may be answered that in this
case, if the soul simultaneously, contain possession and
privation of the good, she will have possessed a feeling
mingled of good and evil, and not of unmingled evil.
We will still not have found the first evil, the absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1159" id="Page_1159">1159</a></span>
Evil. The good of the soul will reside in her essence
(being); evil will only be an accident thereof.</p>

<h3>EVIL AS AN OBSTACLE TO THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>13. Another hypothesis is that evil owes its character
only to its being an obstacle for the soul, as
certain objects are bad for the eye, because they hinder
it from seeing. In this case, the evil of the soul would
be the cause that produces the evil, and it would produce
it without being absolute Evil. If, then, vice be
an obstacle for the soul, it will not be absolute Evil, but
the cause of evil, as virtue is not the good, and only
contributes to acquiring it. If virtue be not good, and
vice be not evil, the result is that since virtue is neither
absolute beauty nor goodness, vice is neither absolute
ugliness nor evil. We hold that virtue is neither absolute
beauty, nor absolute goodness, because above
and before it is absolute Beauty and Goodness. Only
because the soul participates in these, is virtue or beauty
considered a good. Now as the soul, by rising above
virtue, meets absolute Beauty and Goodness, thus in
descending below wickedness the soul discovers absolute
Evil. To arrive at the intuition of evil the soul,
therefore, starts from wickedness, if indeed an intuition
of evil be at all possible. Finally, when the soul descends,
she participates in evil. She rushes completely
into the region of <span class="locked">diversity,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span> and, plunging downwards
she falls into a murky mire. If she fell into
absolute wickedness, her characteristic would no longer
be wickedness, and she would exchange it for a still
lower nature. Even though mingled with a contrary
nature, wickedness, indeed, still retains something
human. The vicious man, therefore, dies so far as a
soul can die. Now when, in connection with the soul,
we speak of dying, we mean that while she is engaged
in the body, she penetrates (further) into matter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1160" id="Page_1160">1160</a></span>
becomes saturated with it. Then, when the soul has
left the body, she once more falls into the same mud
until she have managed to return into the intelligible
world, and weaned her glance from this mire. So long
as she remains therein, she may be said to have descended
into hell, and to be slumbering <span class="locked">there.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span></p>

<h3>WEAKNESS OF THE SOUL AS AN EXPLANATION OF
EVIL.</h3>

<p>14. Wickedness is by some explained as weakness
of the soul, because the wicked soul is impressionable,
mobile, easy to lead to evil, disposed to listen to her
passions, and equally likely to become angry, and to
be reconciled; she yields inconsiderately to vain ideas,
like the weakest works of art and of nature, which
are easily destroyed by winds and storms. This theory
(is attractive, but implies a totally new conception, that
of "weakness" of soul, and it would have) to explain
this "weakness," and whence it is derived; for weakness
in a soul is very different from weakness in a
body, but just as in the body weakness consists in inability
to fulfil a function, in being too impressionable,
the same fault in the soul might, by analogy, be called
by the same name, unless matter be equally the cause
of both weaknesses. Reason, however, will have to
explore the problem further, and seek the cause of the
soul-fault here called weakness.</p>

<h3>WEAKNESS OF THE SOUL OCCURS CHIEFLY IN
SOULS FALLEN INTO MATTER.</h3>

<p>In the soul weakness does not derive from an excess
of density or rarefaction of leanness or stoutness, nor
of any sickness such as fever. It must be met in souls
which are either entirely separated from matter, or in
those joined to matter, or in both simultaneously. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1161" id="Page_1161">1161</a></span>
as it does not occur in souls separated from matter,
which are entirely pure, and <span class="locked">"winged,"<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span> and which,
as perfect, carry out their functions without any obstacle;
it remains, that this weakness occurs in fallen
souls, which are neither pure nor purified. For them
weakness consists not in the privation of anything, but
in the presence of something alien, just as, for instance,
weakness of the body consists in the presence of slime
or bile. We shall, therefore, be able to understand
clearly the weakness of the soul by ferreting out the
cause of the "fall" of the soul.</p>

<h3>THE FALL OF THE SOUL AS DESCENT INTO MATTER.</h3>

<p>Just as much as the soul, matter is included within
the order of beings. For both, so to speak, there is
but a single locality; for it would be an error to imagine
two different localities, one for matter, and the other
for the soul; such as, for instance, earth might be for
matter, and air for the soul. The expression that "soul
occupies a locality different from matter" means only
that the soul is not in matter; that is, that the soul is
not united to matter; that the soul does not together
with matter constitute something unitary; and that for
the soul matter is not a substrate that could contain the
soul. That is how the soul is separated from matter.
But the soul possesses several powers, since she contains
the principle (intelligence), the medium (the
discursive reason), and the goal (the power of sensation)
(united to the generative and growing powers).
Now, just like the beggar who presents himself at the
door of the banquet-hall, and with importunity asks to
be <span class="locked">admitted,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span> matter tries to penetrate into the place
occupied by the soul. But every place is sacred, because
nothing in it is deprived of the presence of the
soul. Matter, on exposing itself to its rays is illuminated
by it, but it cannot harbor the principle that illuminates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1162" id="Page_1162">1162</a></span>
her (the soul). The latter indeed, does not sustain
<span class="locked">matter,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span> although she be present, and does not
even see it, because it is evil. Matter obscures, weakens
the light that shines down upon her, by mingling its
darkness with her. To the soul, matter affords the
opportunity of producing generation, by clearing free
access towards matter; for if matter were not present,
the soul would not approach it. The fall of the soul
is, therefore, a descent into matter; hence comes her
"weakness," which means, that not all of the soul's
faculties are exercised; because matter hinders their
action, intruding on the place occupied by the soul and
forcing her, so to speak, to retrench. Until the soul
can manage to accomplish her return into the intelligible
world, matter degrades what it has succeeded in
abstracting from the soul. For the soul, therefore,
matter is a cause of weakness and vice. Therefore, by
herself, the soul is primitively evil, and is the first evil.
By its presence, matter is the cause of the soul's exerting
her generative powers, and being thus led to
suffering; it is matter that causes the soul to enter into
dealings with matter, and thus to become evil. The
soul, indeed, would never have approached matter
unless the latter's presence had not afforded the soul
an opportunity to produce generation.</p>

<h3>NO MORE THAN THE EXISTENCE OF THE GOOD CAN
THAT OF MATTER BE DENIED.</h3>

<p>15. Those who claim that matter does not exist,
will have to be referred to our extended <span class="locked">discussion<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span>
where we have demonstrated the necessity of its hypostatic
existence. Those who would assert that evil does
not belong among beings would, if logical, thereby also
deny the existence of the good, and of anything that
was desirable; thereby annihilating desire, as well as
aversion, and even thought; for everybody shares desire
for the good, and aversion for the evil. Thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1163" id="Page_1163">1163</a></span>
and knowledge, simultaneously, apply to good and evil;
thought itself is a good.</p>

<h3>EXPLANATION OF THE EVIL OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>We must, therefore, acknowledge the existence first
of Good, unmixed, and then the nature mingled of
good and evil; but what most participates in evil
thereby trends towards absolute Evil; and what participates
in it to a less degree thereby trends towards
good. For what is evil to soul? It is being in contact
with inferior nature; otherwise the soul would not have
any appetite, pain, or fear. Indeed fear is felt by us
only for the composite (of soul and body), fearing its
dissolution, which thus is the cause of our pains and
sufferings. The end of every appetite is to put aside
what troubles it, or to forestall what might do so. As
to sense-representations (fancy<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>), it is the impression
made by an exterior object on the irrational part of the
soul, a part which can receive this impression only because
it is not indivisible. False opinion rises within
the soul because it is no longer within truth, and this
occurs because the soul is no longer pure. On the contrary,
the desire of the intelligible leads the soul to
unite intimately with intelligence, as she should, and
there remain solidly entrenched, without declining towards
anything inferior. It is only because of the
nature and power of the Good that evil does not remain
pure Evil. (Matter, which is synonymous with
evil) is like a captive which beauty covers with golden
chains, so that the divinities might not see its nakedness,
and that men might not be intruded on by it; or
that men, if they must see it, shall be reminded of
beauty on observing an even weakened image thereof.</p>

<h3>OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARS.</h3>

<p>1. It has been <span class="locked">said<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> that the course of the stars
indicates what is to happen to each being; though, it
does not, as many persons think, cause every event.
To the supporting proofs hereof we are to add now
more precise demonstrations, and new considerations,
for the opinion held about this matter is no trifle.</p>

<h3>VARIOUS PRETENSIONS OF ASTROLOGY.</h3>

<p>Some people hold that, by their movements, the
planets produce not only poverty and wealth, health
and sickness, but even beauty and ugliness; and, what
is more, vices and virtues. At every moment the stars,
as if they were irritated against men, (are said to)
force them to commit actions concerning which no
blame attaches to the men who commit them, since
they are compelled thereto by the influence of the
planets. It is even believed that the cause of the
planets' doing us evil or good is not that they love or
hate us; but that their dispositions towards us is good
or evil according to the localities through which they
travel. Towards us they change their disposition according
as they are on the cardinal points or in declination
therefrom. It is even held that while certain stars
are maleficent, others are beneficent, and that, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1166" id="Page_1166">1166</a></span>
the former frequently grant us benefits, while
the latter often become harmful. Their effects differ according
to their being in <span class="locked">opposition,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span> just as if they were
not self-sufficient, and as if their quality depended on
whether or not they looked at each other. Thus a
star's (influence) may be good so long as it regards
another, and evil when it does so no longer. A star
may even consider another in different <span class="locked">manners,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span> when
it is in such or such an <span class="locked">aspect.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span> Moreover, the totality
of the stars exercises a mingled influence which differs
from the individual influences, just as several liquors
may form a compound possessing qualities differing
from either of the component elements. As these and
similar assertions are freely made, it becomes important
to examine each one separately. This would form a
proper beginning for our investigation.</p>

<h3>ARE STARS INANIMATE?</h3>

<p>2. Should we consider the stars to be animated, or
not? If they be inanimate, they will be able to communicate
only cold and heat; that is, if<a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> we grant
the existence of cold influences. In this case, they will
limit themselves to modifying the nature of our body,
exercising on us a merely corporeal influence. They
will not produce a great diversity among the bodies,
since each of them exercises the same influence, and
since, on the earth, their diverse actions are blended
into a single one, which varies only by the diversity of
locality, or by the proximity or distance of the objects.
The same argument would hold on the hypothesis that
the stars spread cold. But I could not understand how
they could render some learned, others ignorant,
making of some grammarians, others orators, musicians
or experts in various arts. How could they exercise
an action which would have no relation to the
constitution of the bodies, such as giving us a father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1167" id="Page_1167">1167</a></span>
a brother, a son, or a wife of such or such characteristics,
or to make us successful, or make of us generals
or kings?<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<h3>ARE STARS ANIMATED?</h3>

<p>On the contrary hypothesis, that the stars are animated,
and act with reflection, what have we done to
them that they should desire to harm us? Are they
not dwellers of a divine region? Are they not themselves
divine? Nor are they subjected to the influences
that make men good or evil, nor could they
experience good or evil as a result of our prosperity or
our misfortunes.</p>

<h3>COULD "CARDINAL POINTS" OR "DECLINATIONS"
POSSESS ANY INFLUENCE?</h3>

<p>3. In case, however, that the stars injure us only
involuntarily, they are constrained thereunto by the
<span class="locked">aspects,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span> and their localities. If so, they should, all of
them, produce the same effects when they find themselves
in the same localities or aspects. But what difference
can occur in a planet according to its location
in the zodiac? What does the zodiac itself experience?
In fact, the planets are not located in the zodiac itself,
but above or below it, at great distances. Besides, in
whatever location they are, they all are ever in the
heaven. Now it would be ridiculous to pretend that
their effects differed according to their location in the
heaven, and that they have an action differing according
as they rise, culminate, or decline. It would be
incredible that such a planet would feel joy when it
culminates, sadness or feebleness when declining, anger
at the rising of some other planet, or satisfaction at the
latter's setting. Can a star be better when it declines?
Now a star culminates for some simultaneously with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1168" id="Page_1168">1168</a></span>
its declination for others; and it could not at the same
time experience joy and sadness, anger and benevolence.
It is sheer absurdity to assert that a star feels joy
at its rising, while another feels the same at its setting;
for this would really mean that the stars felt simultaneous
joy and sadness. Besides, why should their
sadness injure us? Nor can we admit that they are in
turn joyous and sad, for they ever remain tranquil,
content with the goods they enjoy, and the objects of
their contemplation. Each of them lives for itself,
finding its welfare in its own activity, without entering
into relations with us. As they have no dealing with
us, the stars exert their influence on us only incidentally,
not as their chief purpose; rather, they bear no
relation whatever to us; they announce the future only
by coincidence, as birds announce it to the augurs.</p>

<h3>ABSURDITY OF "ASPECTS," AND "HOUSES."</h3>

<p>4. Nor is it any more reasonable to assert that the
aspect of one planet makes one joyous, or the other
sad. What animosity could obtain betwixt the stars?
What could be its reason? Why should their condition
be different when they are in trine aspect, or in
opposition, or in quadrature? What reason have we
to suppose that one star regards the other when it is
in some particular aspect to it, or that it no more regards
it when it is in the next zodiacal sign, though
thus really closer to it?</p>

<p>Besides, what is the manner in which the planets
exert the influence attributed to them? How does
each exercise its own particular influence? How do
they all, in combination, exert an influence that differs
from this (particular influence)? In fact, they
do not hold deliberations to carry out their decisions
on us, each of them yielding a little of its individual
influence. The one does not violently hinder the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1169" id="Page_1169">1169</a></span>
action of the other, nor does it condescendingly make
concessions to it. To say that the one is joyous when
it is in the "house" of the other, and that the latter is
sad when it is in "house" of the former, amounts to
saying that two men are united by mutual friendship,
though the former love the latter, while the latter hate
the former.</p>

<h3>THE RELATIONS OF SATURN AND MARS QUITE
ILLOGICAL.</h3>

<p>5. The cold planet (Saturn) is said to be more
beneficent for us when it is distant, because the evil
that it produces on us is said to consist of its cold
effluence; in which case our good should consist in the
zodiacal signs opposite to us. It is also asserted that
when the cold planet (Saturn) is in opposition to the
warm planet (Mars), both become harmful; yet it
would seem that their influences should neutralize each
other. Besides, it is held that (Saturn) likes the day,
whose heat renders it favorable to men, while (Mars)
likes the night, because it is fiery, as if in heaven there
did not reign a perpetual day, that is, a continual light;
or as if a star could be plunged into the shadow (projected
by the earth) when it is very distant from the
earth.</p>

<h3>FABULOUS INFLUENCES OF THE MOON.</h3>

<p>It is said that the moon, in conjunction with (Saturn)
is favorable when full, but harmful when otherwise.
The opposite, however, ought to be the truth if the
moon possess any influence. In fact, when it presents
a full face, it presents its dark face to the planet above
it (Saturn or Mars); when its disk decreases on our
side, it increases on the other; therefore, it ought to
exert a contrary influence when it decreases on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1170" id="Page_1170">1170</a></span>
side, and when it increases on the side of the planet
above it. These phases are of no importance for the
moon, inasmuch as one of its sides is always lit.
Nothing can result from it but for the planet which
receives heat from it (Saturn); now this one will be
heated whenever the moon turns towards us its dark
side. Therefore, the moon is good for this planet
when it is full towards it, but dark towards us. Besides,
this obscurity of the moon for us can be of importance
only for terrestrial things, not for the
<span class="locked">celestial<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span> ... (?)<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> ... but if, because of
its distance, it does not support the moon, then it must
be in a worse predicament; when the moon is full, it
is sufficient for terrestrial things, even when the moon
is distant.... Finally, when the moon presents its
obscure side to the fiery planet (Mars), it seems beneficent
towards us; for the power of this planet, more
fiery than (Saturn), is then sufficient by itself.</p>

<h3>JUPITER, VENUS, AND MERCURY ALSO CONSIDERED
ASTROLOGICALLY.</h3>

<p>Besides, the bodies of the animated beings which
move in the heaven may be of different degrees of
heat; none of them is cold, as is witnessed to by their
location. The planet named Jupiter is a suitable mixture
of fire; likewise with Venus. That is why they
seem to move harmoniously. As to the fiery planet
Mars, it contributes its share to the mixture (of the
general action of the stars). As to Saturn, its case is
different, because of its distance. Mercury is indifferent,
because it assimilates itself easily to all.</p>

<h3>THE UNIVERSE AS A SINGLE HARMONY.<a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></h3>

<p>All these planets contribute to the Whole. Their
mutual relation, therefore, is one suitable to the universe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1171" id="Page_1171">1171</a></span>
just as the organs of an animal are shaped to
take part in the organism they <span class="locked">constitute.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span> Take, for
instance, a part of the body, such as the bile, which
serves both the whole animal that contains it, and its
special organ, inasmuch as it was necessary to arouse
courage, and to oppose the injury of both the whole
body, and its special organ. There had to be something
similar (to bile) in the universe; that something
sweet should soften it, that there be parts that would
play the role of eyes, and that all things should possess
mutual sympathy by their irrational <span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span> Thus
only is the universe one, and thus only is it constituted
by a single harmony. How then could it be denied
that all these things might be signs, resulting from the
laws of analogy?</p>

<h3>ABSURDITY OF VARIOUS ASTROLOGICAL THEORIES.</h3>

<p>6. Is it not unreasonable to assert that Mars, or
Venus, in a certain position, should produce adulteries?
Such a statement attributes to them incontinence such
as occurs only among man, and human passion to
satisfy unworthy impulses. Or again, how could we
believe that the aspects of planets is favorable when
they regard each other in a certain manner? How
can we avoid believing that their nature is determinate?
What sort of an existence would be led by the
planets if they occupied themselves with each single
one of the innumerable ever-arising and passing beings,
giving them each glory, wealth, poverty, or incontinence,
and impelling all their actions? How could the
single planets effect so many simultaneous results?
Nor is it any more rational to suppose that the planets'
actions await the ascensions of the signs, nor to say
that the ascension of a sign contains as many years
as there are degrees of ascension in it. Absurd also is
the theory that the planets calculate, as it were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1172" id="Page_1172">1172</a></span>
their fingers, the period of time when they are to accomplish
something, which before was forbidden. Besides,
it is an error not to trace to a single principle
the government of the universe, attributing everything
to the stars, as if there were not a single Chief from
which depends the universe, and who distributes to
every being a part and functions suitable to its nature.
To fail to recognize Him, is to destroy the order of
which we form a part, it is to ignore the nature of the
world, which presupposes a primary cause, a principle
by whose activity everything is <span class="locked">interpenetrated.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span></p>

<h3>THE STARS ARE CHANGING SIGNS BETRAYING THE
UNIVERSAL CONSPIRACY OF PURPOSE.</h3>

<p>7. In fact, we would still have to ask ourselves for
the cause of the events (in our world) even if the stars,
like many other things, really prognosticated future
events. We would still have to wonder at the maintenance
of the order without which no events could be
prefigured. We might, therefore, liken the stars to
letters, at every moment flung along the heavens, and
which, after having been displayed, continued in ceaseless
motion, so that, while exercising another function
in the universe, they would still possess <span class="locked">significance.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span>
Thus in a being animated by a single principle it is
possible to judge one part by another; as it is possible,
by the study of the eyes or some other organ of an
individual, to conclude as to his characters, to the
dangers to which he is exposed, and how he may
escape them. Just as our members are parts of our
bodies, so are we ourselves parts of the universe.
Things, therefore, are made for each other. Everything
is significant, and the wise man can conclude
from one thing to another. Indeed many habitual occurrences
are foreseen by men generally. In the universe
everything is reduced to a single <span class="locked">system.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1173" id="Page_1173">1173</a></span>
this co-ordination is due the possibility of birds furnishing
us with omens, and other animals furnishing us
with presages. All things mutually depend from each
other. Everything conspires to a single <span class="locked">purpose,<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span>
not only in each individual, whose parts are perfectly
related; but also in the universe, and that in a higher
degree, and far earlier. This multiple being could be
turned into a single universal Living organism only by
a single principle. As in the human body every organ
has its individual function, likewise in the universe
each being plays its individual part; so much the more
that they not only form part of the universe, but that
they themselves also form universes not without importance.<a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
All things, therefore, proceed from a
single principle, each plays its individual part, and lends
each other mutual assistance. Neither are they separate
from the universe, but they act and react on each
other, each assisting or hindering the other. But their
progress is not fortuitous, nor is it the result of chance.
They form a series, where each, by a natural bond, is
the effect of the preceding one, and the cause of the
following <span class="locked">one.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span></p>

<h3>THERE IS A NATURAL LAW WHICH DIRECTS THE
SOUL.</h3>

<p>8. When the soul applies herself to carry out her
proper <span class="locked">function<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span>&mdash;for the soul effects everything, as
far as she plays the part of a principle&mdash;she follows
the straight <span class="locked">road;<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> when she loses her <span class="locked">way<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span> the
divine justice subjugates her to the physical order
which reigns in the <span class="locked">universe,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span> unless the soul succeed
in liberating herself. The divine <span class="locked">justice<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span> reigns ever,
because the universe is directed by the order and power
of the dominating principle (the universal Soul).<a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> To
this is joined the co-operation of the planets which are
important parts of the heaven, either by embellishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1174" id="Page_1174">1174</a></span>
it, or by serving as signs. Now they serve as signs for
all things that occur in the sense-world. As to their
potency, they should be credited only with what they
effect indisputably.</p>

<h3>WEALTH, POVERTY, AND VICES ARE THE RESULT
OF EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES.</h3>

<p>As to us, we fill the functions of the soul in accordance
with nature when we do not stray into the multiplicity
contained in the universe. When we do stray
therein, we are punished for it both by the straying
itself, and by a less happy fate thereafter. Wealth
and poverty, therefore, happen to us as effects of the
operation of exterior things. As to the virtues and
vices, virtues are derived from the primitive nature of
the soul, while the vices result from dealings of the
soul with exterior things. But this has been treated of
elsewhere.<a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPINDLE OF THE FATES.</h3>

<p>9. This brings us to a consideration of the spindle,
which, according to the ancients, is turned by the
Fates, and by which Plato <span class="locked">signifies<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></span> that which, in the
evolution of the world, moves, and that which is immovable.
According to (Plato), it is the Fates, and
their mother Necessity, which turn this spindle, and
which impress it with a rotary motion in the generation
of each being. It is by this motion that begotten beings
arrive at generation. In the <span class="locked">Timaeus<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></span> the (Intelligence,
or) divinity which has created the universe gives
the (immortal) principle of the soul, (the reasonable
soul), and the deities which revolve in the heaven add
(to the immortal principle of the soul) the violent
passions which subject us to Necessity, namely, angers,
desires, sufferings, and pleasures; in short, they furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1175" id="Page_1175">1175</a></span>
us with that other kind of soul (the animal nature, or
vegetable soul) from which they derive these passions.
Plato thus seems to subject us to the stars, by hinting
that we receive from them our <span class="locked">souls,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span> subordinating to
the sway of Necessity when we descend here below,
both ourselves and our morals, and through these, the
"actions" and <span class="locked">"passions"<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></span> which are derived from the
passional habit<a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> of the soul (the animal nature).<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<h3>WHICH OF OUR TWO SOULS IS THE GENUINE
INDIVIDUALITY?</h3>

<p>Our genuine selves are what is essentially "us"; we
are the principle to which Nature has given the power
to triumph over the passions. For, if we be surrounded
by evils because of the body, nevertheless, the divinity
has given us virtue, which "knows of no <span class="locked">master"<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span>
(is not subject to any compulsion). Indeed we need
virtue not so much when we are in a calm state, but
when its absence exposes us to evils. We must, therefore,
flee from here <span class="locked">below;<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span> we must divorce ourselves
from the body added to us in generation, and
apply ourselves to the effort to cease being this animal,
this composite in which the predominant element is
the nature of the body, a nature which is only a trace
of the soul, and which causes animal <span class="locked">life<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span> to pertain
chiefly to the body. Indeed, all that relates to this life
is corporeal. The other soul (the reasonable soul,
which is superior to the vegetative soul), is not in the
body; she rises to the beautiful, to the divine, and to all
the intelligible things, which depend on nothing else.
She then seeks to identify herself with them, and lives
conformably to the divinity when retired within herself
(in contemplation). Whoever is deprived of this soul
(that is, whoever does not exercise the faculties of the
reasonable soul), lives in subjection to <span class="locked">fatality.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></span> Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1176" id="Page_1176">1176</a></span>
the actions of such a being are not only indicated by
the stars, but he himself becomes a part of the world,
and he depends on the world of which he forms a part.
Every man is <span class="locked">double,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span> for every man contains both
the composite (organism), and the real man (which
constitutes the reasonable soul).</p>

<h3>NUMENIAN DOUBLENESS, MIXTURE, AND DIVISIBLE
SOUL.</h3>

<p>Likewise the universe is a compound of a body and
of a Soul intimately united to it, and of the universal
Soul, which is not in the Body, and which irradiates the
Soul united to the <span class="locked">Body.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span> There is a similar doubleness
in the sun and the other stars, (having a soul united
to their body, and a soul independent thereof). They
do nothing that is shameful for the pure soul. The
things they produce are parts of the universe, inasmuch
as they themselves are parts of the universe, and inasmuch
as they have a body, and a soul united to this
body; but their will and their real soul apply themselves
to the contemplation of the good Principle. It
is from this Principle, or rather from that which surrounds
it, that other things depend, just as the fire
radiates its heat in all directions, and as the superior
Soul (of the universe) infuses somewhat of her potency
into the lower connected soul. The evil things
here below originate in the mixture inhering in the
nature of this world. After separating the universal Soul
out of the universe, the remainder would be worthless.
Therefore, the universe is a deity if the Soul that is
separable from it be included within its substance. The
remainder constitutes the guardian which (Plato)
names the Great <span class="locked">Guardian,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></span> and which, besides, possesses
all the passions proper to guardians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1177" id="Page_1177">1177</a></span></p>

<h3>STARS ANNOUNCE EVENTS BECAUSE OF THE SOUL'S
MANY IMPERFECTIONS, AND ACCIDENTS.</h3>

<p>10. Under these circumstances, we must acknowledge
that events are, by the stars, announced, though
not produced, not even by their (lower) corporeal
soul. By their lower part, their <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span> they produce
only the things which are passions of the universe.
Besides, we shall have to acknowledge, that the soul,
even before entering into generation, while descending
here below, brings something which she has by herself;
for she would not enter into a body unless she had a
great disposition to <span class="locked">suffer.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span> We must also admit that
while passing into a body the soul is exposed to accidents,
inasmuch as she is subjected to the course of
the universe, and as this very course contributes to the
production of what the universe is to accomplish; for
the things which are comprised in the course of the
universe act as its parts.</p>

<h3>THE INFLUENCES OF THE STARS DEGENERATE AS
THEY REACH US.</h3>

<p>11. We must also reflect that the impressions
which we derive from the stars do not reach us in the
same condition in which they leave them. Just as fire
in us is much degenerated from that in the heaven, so
sympathy, degenerating within the receiving person,
begets an unworthy affection. Courage produces in
those who do not possess it in the proper proportions,
either violence or cowardliness. Love of the beautiful
and good thus becomes the search for what only appears
so. Discernment, in undergoing this degradation,
becomes the trickiness which seeks to equal it,
without succeeding in doing so. Thus all these qualities
become evil in us, without being such in the stars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1178" id="Page_1178">1178</a></span>
All the impressions we receive thereof are in us not
such as they are in the stars; besides they are still
further degraded by mingling with the bodies, with
matter, and with each <span class="locked">other.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span></p>

<h3>MINGLED STAR ACTION ONLY PROMOTES OR
RETARDS PROCESSES ALREADY NATURAL.</h3>

<p>12. The influences proceeding from the stars
commingle; and this mixture modifies all generated
things, determining their nature and <span class="locked">qualities.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span> It
is not the celestial influence which produces the horse,
it is limited to exercising an influence upon him; <span class="locked">for,<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></span>
the horse is begotten from horse, man from man; the
sun can only contribute to their formation. Man is
born from the (seminal logos), or reason of man;
but the circumstances may be favorable or unfavorable
to him. In fact, a son resembles the father, though he
may be formed better or worse; but never does he
entirely detach himself from matter. Sometimes, however,
the matter so prevails over nature that the being
is imperfect because the form does not <span class="locked">dominate.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span></p>

<h3>DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT
PRODUCED BY THE STARS.</h3>

<p>13. We must now distinguish, decide and express
the origin of various things, inasmuch as there are
some things that are produced by the course of the
stars, and others that are not. Our principle is that
the Soul governs the universe by Reason, just as each
animal is governed by the principle (the reason) which
fashions his organs, and harmonizes them with the
whole of which they are <span class="locked">parts;<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span> now the All contains
everything, while the parts contain only what is individual
to them. As to exterior influences, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1179" id="Page_1179">1179</a></span>
assist, while others oppose the tendency of nature. All
things are subordinated to the All because they are
parts of it; by their co-operation, each with its own
nature and their particular tendencies they form the
total life of the <span class="locked">universe.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span> The inanimate beings
serve as instruments for the others that set them in
motion by a mechanical impulse. Irrational animated
beings move indeterminately; such as horses attached
to a chariot before the driver indicates which direction
they are to follow; for they need the whip to be
directed. The nature of the reasonable animal contains
the directing <span class="locked">driver;<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></span> if the driver be skilful, it follows
the straight road, instead of going blindly at chance, as
often happens. Beings gifted with reason and those that
lack it are both contained within the universe, and contribute
to the formation of the whole. Those which
are more powerful, and which occupy a more elevated
rank do many important things, and co-operate in the
life of the universe where their part is active, rather
than passive. The passive ones act but little. Those
of intermediary rank are passive in regard to some,
and often active in regard to others, because they
themselves possess the power of action and production
(the stars, the brutes, and <span class="locked">men.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></span>).</p>

<h3>THE STARS AS THE FOLLOWERS OF THE UNIVERSAL
KING.</h3>

<p>The universe leads an universal and perfect life,
because the good principles (the star-Souls) produce
excellency, that is, the more excellent part in every
<span class="locked">object.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span> These principles are subordinate to the Soul
that governs the universe, as soldiers are to their
general; consequently, (Plato) describes this by the
figure of the attendants of Jupiter (the universal Soul)
advancing to the contemplation of the intelligible
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1180" id="Page_1180">1180</a></span></p>

<h3>MEN AS SOULS OF THE SECOND RANK.</h3>

<p>The beings which possess a nature inferior to the
star-Souls, that is, men, occupy the second rank in the
universe, and play in it the same part played in us by
the second power of the soul (the discursive reason).
The other beings, that is, the animals, occupy about
the same rank occupied in us by the lowest (or vegetative)
power of the soul; for all these powers in us are
not of equal <span class="locked">rank.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></span> Consequently, all the beings
which are in the heaven, or which are distributed in
the universe are animated beings, and derive their life
from the total Reason of the universe (because it contains
the "seminal reasons" of all living beings). None
of the parts of the universe, whatever be its greatness,
possesses the power of altering the reasons, nor the
beings engendered with the co-operation of these
reasons. It may improve or degrade these beings, but
cannot deprive them of their individual nature. It
degrades them by injuring either their body or their
soul; which occurs when an accident becomes a cause
of vice for the soul which partakes of the passions of
the body (the sensitive and vegetative soul) and which
is given over to the inferior principle (to the animal)
by the superior principle (the reasonable soul); or
when the body, by its poor organization, hinders the
actions in which the soul needs its co-operation; then
it resembles a badly attuned lyre, which is incapable of
producing sounds which could form a perfect <span class="locked">harmony.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></span></p>

<h3>ANY OCCURRENCE MAY BE DUE TO MANY
DIFFERENT CAUSES.</h3>

<p>14. Poverty, wealth, glory, and authoritative
positions may have many different causes. If a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1181" id="Page_1181">1181</a></span>
derive his wealth from his parents, the stars have only
announced that he would be rich; and they would have
only announced his nobility if he owed his wealth to
his birth. If a man acquire wealth by his merit, in
some way in which his body contributed thereto, the
causes of his bodily vigor co-operated in his fortune;
first his parents, then his fatherland, if it be possessed
of a good climate, and last the fertility of the <span class="locked">soil.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span>
If this man owe his wealth to virtue, this source should
be considered exclusive; and likewise with the transitory
advantages he may by divine favor possess. Even
if his wealth be derived from virtuous persons, still, in
another way, his fortune is due to virtue. If his wealth
were derived from evil men, though by a just means,
yet the wealth proceeds from a good principle which
was active in them. Finally, if a man who has amassed
wealth be evil, the cause of his fortune is this very
wickedness, and the principle from which it derives;
even those who may have given him money must be
included in the order of its causes. If a man owe his
wealth to labor, such as agricultural work, the causes
of the wealth include the care of the ploughman and
the co-operation of exterior circumstances. Even if
he found a treasure, it is something in the universe
which contributed thereto. Besides, this discovery may
have been foretold; for all things concatenate with
everything else, and, consequently, announce each
other. If a man scatter his wealth, he is the cause of
their loss; if his wealth be taken from him, the cause
is the man who takes it. Many are the contributory
causes of a shipwreck. Glory may be acquired justly
or unjustly. Just glory is due to services rendered, or
to the esteem of other people. Unjust glory is caused
by the injustice of those who glorify that man. Deserved
power is due to the good sense of the electors,
or to the activity of the man who acquired it by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1182" id="Page_1182">1182</a></span>
co-operation of his friends, or to any other circumstance.
A marriage is determined by a preference, or
by some accidental circumstance, or by the co-operation
of several circumstances. The procreation of children
is one of its consequences; it occurs in accordance with
the ("seminal) reason," in case it meet no obstacle;
if it be defective, there must be some interior defect
in the pregnant mother, or the fault lies in the impotence
of the father.</p>

<h3>A SOUL'S DESTINY DEPENDS ON THE CONDITION
OF THE UNIVERSE AT BIRTH.</h3>

<p>15. <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span> speaks of the lots, and conditions
chosen by one turn of the spindle (of Clotho); he
speaks also of a guardian who helps each man to fulfil
his destiny. These conditions are the disposition of
the universe at the time of the soul's entrance into the
body, the nature of their body, parents and fatherland;
in short, the aggregate of external circumstances.
Evidently all these things, in detail as well as in totality,
are simultaneously produced and related by one of the
Fates, namely Clotho. Lachesis then presents the
conditions to the souls. Finally Atropos renders the
accomplishment of all the circumstances of each destiny
irrevocable.</p>

<h3>HOW SOME MEN MAY MASTER THEIR FATE: BY
SELF-VICTORY.</h3>

<p>Some men, fascinated by the universe and exterior
objects, completely or partially abdicate their <span class="locked">freedom.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></span>
Others, dominating their environment, raise
their head to the sky, and freeing themselves from
exterior circumstances, release that better part of their
souls which forms their primitive being. As to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1183" id="Page_1183">1183</a></span>
latter point, it would be wrong to think that the nature
of the soul was determined by the passions aroused in
her by external objects, and that she did not possess
her own individual nature. On the contrary, as she
plays the part of a principle, she possesses, much more
than other things, faculties suitable to accomplish
actions suitable to her nature. Since she is a being,
the soul necessarily possesses appetites, active faculties,
and the power of living <span class="locked">well.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></span> The aggregate (of
the soul and body, the organism) depends on the nature
which formed it, and from it receives its qualities and
actions. If the soul separate from the body, she produces
actions which are suitable to her nature, and
which do not depend from the body; she does not
appropriate the credit for the passions of the body,
because she recognizes the difference of her <span class="locked">nature.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span></p>

<h3>EXACT PSYCHOLOGY AT THE ROOT OF
PHILOSOPHY.</h3>

<p>16. What is the mingled, and what is the pure part
of the soul? What part of the soul is separable?
What part is not separable so long as the soul is in a
body? What is the animal? This subject will have
to be studied <span class="locked">elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></span> for there is practically no
agreement on the subject. For the present, let us
explain in which sense we above said that the soul
governs the universe by Reason.</p>

<h3>IS THE UNIVERSAL SOUL CREATIVE, BUT NOT
PRESERVATIVE?</h3>

<p>Does the universal Soul form all the beings successively,
first man, then the horse, then some other
animal, and last the wild beasts?<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Does she begin by
producing earth and fire; then, seeing the co-operation
of all these things which mutually destroy or assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1184" id="Page_1184">1184</a></span>
each other, does she consider only their totality and
their connections, without regarding the accidents
which occur to them later? Does she limit herself to
the reproduction of preceding generations of animals,
and does she leave these exposed to the passions with
which they inspire each other?</p>

<h3>DETERMINISM IMPLIES DEGENERATION OF RACES.</h3>

<p>Does the "reason" of each individual contain both
his "actions" and <span class="locked">"reactions"<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span> in a way such that
these are neither accidental nor fortuitous, but necessary?<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>
Are these produced by the reasons? Or do
the reasons know them, without producing them? Or
does the soul, which contains the generative <span class="locked">"reasons,"<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></span>
know the effects of all her works by reasoning
according to the following principle, that the concourse
of the same circumstances must evidently produce the
same effects? If so, the soul, understanding or foreseeing
the effects of her works, by them determines
and concatenates all the events that are to happen.
She, therefore, considers all the antecedents and consequents,
and foresees what is to follow from what
<span class="locked">precedes.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></span> It is (because the beings thus proceed
from each other) that the races continually degenerate.
For instance, men degenerate because in departing continually
and unavoidably (from the primitive type) the
("seminal) reasons" yield to the "passions" of
<span class="locked">matter.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SOUL DOES NOT CAUSE PASSIONS, WHICH
ARISE FROM THE SEMINAL REASONS.</h3>

<p>Is the soul the cause of these passions, because she
begets the beings that produce them? Does the soul
then consider the whole sequence of events, and does
she pass her existence watching the "passions" experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1185" id="Page_1185">1185</a></span>
by her works? Does she never cease thinking
of the latter, does she never put on them the
finishing touch, regulating them so that they should
always go well?<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> Does she resemble some farmer
who, instead of limiting himself to sowing and planting,
should ceaselessly labor to repair the damage
caused by the rains, the winds, and the storms? Unless
this hypothesis be absurd, it must be admitted that
the soul knows in advance, or even that the ("seminal)<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
reasons" contain accidents which happen to
begotten beings, that is, their destruction and all the
effects of their <span class="locked">faults.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></span> In this case, we are obliged
to say that the faults are derived from the ("seminal)
reasons", although the arts and their reasons contain
neither error, fault, nor destruction of a work of <span class="locked">art.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></span></p>

<p>THE UNIVERSE IS <span class="locked">HARMONY,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> IN SPITE OF THE
FAULTS IN THE DETAILS.</p>

<p>It might here be objected that there could not be in
the universe anything bad or contrary to nature; and
it must be acknowledged that even what seems less
good still has its utility. If this seem to admit that
things that are less good contribute to the perfection of
the universe, and that there is no necessity that all
things be <span class="locked">beautiful,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></span> it is only because the very contraries
contribute to the perfection of the universe,
and so the world could not exist without them. It is
likewise with all living beings. The ("seminal)
reason" necessarily produces and forms what is better;
what is less good is contained in the "potentiality" of
the "reasons," and "actualized" in the begotten beings.
The (universal) Soul has, therefore, no need to busy
herself therewith, nor to cause the "reasons" to become
active. For the "reasons" successfully subdue
matter to what is better (the forms), even though
matter alters what it receives by imparting a shock to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1186" id="Page_1186">1186</a></span>
the "reasons" that proceed from the higher principles.
All things, therefore, form a harmonious totality because
they simultaneously proceed from matter, and
the "reasons" which beget them.</p>

<h3>THE METHOD OF CREATION.</h3>

<p>17. Let us examine if the "reasons" contained in
the Soul are thoughts. How could the Soul produce
by thoughts? It is the Reason which produces in
matter; but the principle that produces naturally is
neither a thought nor an intuition, but a power that
fashions matter unconsciously, just as a circle gives
water a circular figure and impression. Indeed, the
natural generative power has the function of production;
but it needs the co-operation of the governing
(principle) of the Soul, which forms and which causes
the activity of the generative soul engaged in matter.
If the governing power of the Soul form the generative
soul by reasoning, it will be considering either another
object, or what it possesses in herself. If the latter
be the case, she has no need of <span class="locked">reasoning,<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></span> for it is
not by reasoning that the Soul fashions matter, but by
the power which contains the reasons, the power which
alone is effective, and capable of production. The
Soul, therefore, produces by the forms. The forms she
transmits are by her received from the Intelligence.
This Intelligence, however, gives the forms to the
universal Soul which is located immediately below her,
and the universal Soul transmits them to the inferior
soul (the natural generative power), fashioning and
illuminating her. The inferior soul then produces, at
one time without meeting any obstacles, at others, when
doing so, although, in the latter case, she produces
things less perfect. As she has received the power of
production, and as she contains the reasons which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1187" id="Page_1187">1187</a></span>
not the first (the "seminal reasons," which are inferior
to the Ideas) not only does she, by virtue of what she
has received, produce, but she also draws from herself
something which is evidently inferior (matter).<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> It
doubtless produces a living being (the universe), but
a living being which is less perfect, and which enjoys
life much less, because it occupies the last rank, because
it is coarse and hard to manage, because the
matter which composes it is, as it were, the bitterness
or the superior principles, because it spreads its bitterness
around her, and communicates some of it to the
universe.</p>

<h3>EVILS ARE NECESSARY TO THE PERFECTION OF
THE UNIVERSE.</h3>

<p>18. Must the evils in the universe be considered as
<span class="locked">necessary,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span> because they are the consequences of the
superior principles? Yes, for without them the universe
would be imperfect. The greater number of evils, if
not all of them, are useful to the universe; such as the
venomous animals; though they often ignore their real
utility. Even wickedness is useful in certain respects,
and can produce many beautiful things; for example,
it leads to fine inventions, it forces men to prudence,
and does not let them fall asleep in an indolent
<span class="locked">security.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></span></p>

<h3>PICTURE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE.</h3>

<p>Under these circumstances, it is plain that the universal
Soul ever contemplates the better principles,
because it is turned towards the intelligible world, and
towards the divinity. As she fills herself with God,
and is filled with God, she, as it were, overflows over
her image, namely, the power which holds the last
rank (the natural generative power), and which, consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1188" id="Page_1188">1188</a></span>
is the last creative power. Above this
creative power is the power of the Soul which immediately
receives the forms from the Intelligence. Above
all is the Intelligence, the Demiurge, who gives the
forms to the universal Soul, and the latter impresses
its traces on the third-rank power (the natural generative
power).<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> This world, therefore, is veritably a
picture which perpetually pictures itself. The two first
principles are immovable; the third is also immovable
(in essence); but it is engaged in matter, and becomes
immovable (only) by accident. As long as the Intelligence
and the Soul subsist, the "reasons" flow
down into this image of the Soul (the natural generative
power); likewise, so long as the sun subsists, all
light emanates <span class="locked">therefrom.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span></p>

<h3>PSYCHOLOGIC DISTINCTIONS IN SOUL.</h3>

<p>1. To what part of our nature do pleasure and
grief, fear and boldness desire and aversion, and, last,
pain, belong? Is it to the soul (herself),<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> or to the
soul when she uses the body as an <span class="locked">instrument,<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></span> or to
some third (combination) of both? Even the latter
might be conceived of in a double sense: it might be
either the simple mixture of the soul and the <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></span>
or some different product resulting <span class="locked">therefrom.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></span> The
same uncertainty obtains about the products of the
above mentioned experiences: namely, <span class="locked">passions,<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span> actions,
and opinions. For example, we may ask whether
ratiocination<a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> and opinion both, belong to the same
principle as the passions; or whether only one of them
does; in which case the other would belong to some
other principle. We should also inquire concerning
the nature and classification of thought.<a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Last we
should study the principle that undertakes this inquiry
and which comes to some conclusion about it. But,
first of all, who is the agent, who feels? This is the
real starting point: for even passions are modes of
feeling, or at least they do not exist without <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SOUL AS A COMPOSITE AGGREGATE.</h3>

<p>2. Let us first examine the soul (herself). Is there
any difference between the soul and the soul-essence?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1192" id="Page_1192">1192</a></span>
If there be a difference, the soul must be a composite
aggregate: and it should no longer be a matter of surprise
that both she and her essence, at least so far as
she admits thereof, together experience the above
mentioned passions, and in general the habits, and
better or worse dispositions. But, on the contrary, if,
soul and soul-essence be identical, then the soul should
be a form which would be unreceptive for all these
energies of essence, which on the contrary she imparts
to other things, possessing in herself a connate
energy which our reason reveals in her. In this case
we must acknowledge that she is immortal, inasmuch
as the immortal and undecaying must be impassible,
giving to others without receiving anything in return
from them; or at least, deriving nothing but from the
superior (or anterior) principles, from which she is
not cut off, inasmuch as they are better.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL IS NOT ESSENCE.</h3>

<p>A being that were so unreceptive to anything external
would have no ground for fear of anything external.
Fear might indeed be natural to something.
Neither would she be bold, for this sentiment, implies
shelter from what is terrifying. As to such desires
which are satisfied by the emptying or filling of the
body, they belong only to some nature foreign enough
to be emptied or filled. How could she participate in
a mixture, inasmuch as the essential is unmingled?
Further she would not wish to have anything introduced
(in herself), for this would imply striving to
become something foreign to herself. She would also
be far from suffering, for how could she grieve, and
about what? For that which is of simple being is self-sufficient,
in that she remains in her own being. Neither
will she rejoice at any increase, as not even the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1193" id="Page_1193">1193</a></span>
could happen to her. What she is, she ever will be.
Nor could we attribute to the pure soul sensation, ratiocination
or opinion; for sensation is the perception, of
a form or of an impassible body; and besides ratiocination
and opinion (depend) on sensation. We shall,
however, have to examine whether or no we should
attribute to the soul thought; also, whether pure pleasure
can affect a soul while she remains <span class="locked">alone.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SOUL USES THE BODY AS TOOL.</h3>

<p>3. Whether the soul, according to her being, be
located in the body, above or within this latter, the
soul forms with the body an entity called (a "living
being" or) <span class="locked">organism.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></span> In this case, the soul using
the body as a tool is not forced to participate in its
passions, any more than workmen participate in the
experiences of their tools. As to sensations, of course,
the soul must perceive them, since in order to use her
instrument, the soul must, by means of sensation,
cognize the modifications that this instrument may receive
from without. Thus seeing consists of using the
eyes; and the soul at the same time feels the evils
which may affect the sight. Similar is the case with
griefs, pains and any corporeal exigency; also with the
desires which arise from the soul's need to take recourse
to the ministry of the body. But how do passions
from the body penetrate into the soul? For a body
could communicate her own properties to some other
body; but how could she do so to a soul?</p>

<h3>SEPARATION OF SOUL FROM BODY.</h3>

<p>Such a process would imply that one individual
suffers when an entirely different individual is affected.
There must be a distinction between them so long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1194" id="Page_1194">1194</a></span>
we consider the former the user, and the latter the used;
and it is <span class="locked">philosophy,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></span> that produces this separation by
giving to the soul the power of using the body as a
tool.</p>

<h3>PRIMITIVE RELATION BETWEEN SOUL AND BODY.</h3>

<p>But what was the condition of the soul before her
separation from the body by philosophy? Was she
mingled with the body? If she were mingled with it,
she must either have been <span class="locked">formed<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span> by <span class="locked">mixing;<a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></span> or she
was spread all over the body; or she <span class="locked">was<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span> a form interwoven
with the body; or she was a form governing
the <span class="locked">body<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span> as a pilot governs the <span class="locked">ship;<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span> <span class="locked">or<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span> was
partly mingled with, and partly separated from, the
body. (In the latter case) I would call the independent
part that which uses the body as a tool, while the
mingled part is that which lowers itself to the classification
or rank of instrument. Now philosophy raises
the latter to the rank of the former; and the detached
part turns her away, as far as our needs allow, from
the body she uses, so that she may not always have to
use the body.</p>

<h3>CONSEQUENCES OF MIXTURE OF SOUL AND BODY.</h3>

<p>4. Now let us suppose the soul is mingled with the
body. In this mixture, the worse part, or body, will
gain, while the soul will lose. The body will improve
by participation with the soul; and the soul will deteriorate
by association with death and irrationality. Well,
does the soul, in somewhat losing life, gain the accession
of sensation? On the other hand, would not the
body, by participation in life, gain sensation and its
derived passions? It is the latter, then, which will
desire, inasmuch as it will enjoy the desired objects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1195" id="Page_1195">1195</a></span>
and will feel fear about them. It is the latter which
may be exposed to the escape of the objects of its
desire, and to <span class="locked">decay.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span></p>

<h3>MIXTURE OF SOUL AND BODY.</h3>

<p>We will set aside as impossible the mixture of two
incommensurables, such as a line and the color called
white. A mixture of the soul and body, which must
imply their commensurability, would demand explanation.
Even if the soul interpenetrate the body, the
soul need not share the body's passions, for the interpenetrating
medium may remain impassible; as light,
which remains such in spite of its <span class="locked">diffusion.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span> Thus
the soul might remain a stranger to the body's passions,
though diffused through it, and need not necessarily
undergo its passions.</p>

<h3>ARISTOTELIAN HYPOTHESIS CONSIDERED.</h3>

<p>Should we say that the soul is in the body, as form
in matter? In this case, she is "being," and she
would be a separable form. If <span class="locked">then<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span> she be in the
body as, in the case of the axe, the schematic figure
is in the iron, so as by her own proper virtue, to form
the power of doing what iron thus formed accomplishes,
we will have all the more reason to attribute
the common passions to the body, which <span class="locked">is<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></span> an organized
physical tool possessing potential life. For if as
(Plato) <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span> it be absurd to suppose that it is the
soul that weaves, it is not any more reasonable to
attribute the desires and griefs to the soul; rather, by
far, to the living organism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1196" id="Page_1196">1196</a></span></p>

<h3>THE LIVING ORGANISM.</h3>

<p>5. The "living organism" must mean either the
thus organized body, or the common mixture of soul
and body, or some third thing which proceeds from
the two first. In either of these three cases the soul
will have to be considered impassible, while the power
of experiencing passions will inhere in something else;
or the soul will have to share the body's passions, in
which case the soul will have to experience passions
either identical or analogous to those of the body, so
that to a desire of the animal there will correspond an
act or a passion of the concupiscible appetite.</p>

<h3>REFUTATION OF THE (JAMES-LANGE) THEORY
OF EMOTIONS.</h3>

<p>We shall later on consider the organized body; here
we must find how the conjunction of soul and body
could experience suffering. The theory that the affection
of the body modifies it so as to produce a sensation
which itself would end in the soul, leaves unexplained
the origin of sensation. To the theory that
suffering has its principle in this opinion or judgment,
that a misfortune is happening to ourselves or some
one related to us, whence results disagreeable emotion
first in the body, and then in the whole living <span class="locked">organism,<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></span>
there is this objection, that it is yet uncertain to
which opinion belongs; to the soul, or to the conjunction
of soul and body. Besides, the opinion of the
presence of an evil does not always entail suffering; it
is possible that, in spite of such an opinion, one feels
no affliction; as, for instance, one may not become
irritated at believing oneself scorned; or in experiencing
no desire even in the expectation of some good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1197" id="Page_1197">1197</a></span></p>

<h3>NOT ALL AFFECTIONS COMMON TO SOUL AND BODY.</h3>

<p>How then arise these affections common to the soul
and the body? Shall we then say that desire derives
from the <span class="locked">desire-appetite,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span> anger from the anger-appetite,
or in short, every emotion or affliction from
the corresponding appetite? But even so, they will
not be common, and they will belong exclusively to
the soul, or to the body. There are some whose
origin needs the excitation of blood and bile, and that
the body be in some certain state which excites desire,
as in physical love. On the contrary, however, the
desire of goodness is no common affection; it is an
affection peculiar to the soul, as are several others.
Reason, therefore, does not allow us to consider all
affections as common to soul and body.</p>

<h3>DESIRE, NOT SIMULTANEOUS WITH APPETITE.</h3>

<p>Is it possible, however, that for example, in physical
love, the <span class="locked">man<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span> may experience a desire simultaneously
with the corresponding appetite? This is impossible,
for two reasons. If we say that the man begins to experience
the desire, while the corresponding appetite
continues it, it is plain the man cannot experience a
desire without the activity of the appetite. If on the
other hand it be the appetite that begins, it is clear
that it cannot begin being excited unless the body first
find itself in suitable circumstances, which is unreasonable.</p>

<h3>SOUL AND BODY, BY UNITING, FORM AN
INDIVIDUAL AGGREGATE.</h3>

<p>6. It would, however, probably be better to put
the matter thus: by their presence, the faculties of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1198" id="Page_1198">1198</a></span>
soul cause reaction in the organs which possess them,
so that while they themselves remain unmoved, they
give them the power to enter into <span class="locked">movement.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></span> In
this case, however, when the living organism experiences
suffering, the life-imparting cause must itself
remain impassible, while the passions and energies
belong wholly to that which receives life. In this
case, therefore, the life will not belong exclusively to
the soul, but to the conjunction of the soul and body;
or, at least, the latter's life will not be identical with
the soul's, nor will it be the faculty of sensation, which
will feel, but the being in whom that faculty inheres.</p>

<h3>SENSATION IMPLIES FEELING SOUL.</h3>

<p>If, however, sensation, which is no more than a
corporeal emotion, finds its term in the soul, the soul
must surely feel sensation; therefore it does not occur
as an effect of the presence of the faculty of sensation,
for this ignores the feeling agent back of it. Nor is
it the conjunction of soul and body, for unless the
faculty of sensation operate, that aggregate could not
feel, and it would then no longer include as elements
either the soul, or the faculty of sensation.</p>

<h3>SOUL-LIGHT FORMS ANIMAL NATURE.</h3>

<p>7. The aggregate results from the presence of the
soul, not indeed that the soul enters into the aggregate,
or constitutes one of its elements. Out of this organized
body, and of a kind of light furnished by herself,
the soul forms the animal nature, which differs both
from soul and body, and to which belongs sensation,
as well as all the passions attributed to the animal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1199" id="Page_1199">1199</a></span><a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<h3>RELATION OF ANIMAL TO HUMAN NATURE.</h3>

<p>If now we should be asked how it happened that
"we" feel, we answer: We are not separated from the
organism, although within us exist <span class="locked">principles<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></span> of a
higher kind which concur in forming the manifold
complex of human nature.</p>

<h3>EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SENSATION.</h3>

<p>As to the faculty of sensation which is peculiar to
the soul, it cannot be the power of perceiving the
sense-objects themselves, but only their typical forms,
impressed on the animal by sensation. These have
already somewhat of the intelligible nature; the exterior
sensation peculiar to the animal is only the
image of the sensation peculiar to the soul; which, by
its very essence is truer and more real, since it consists
only in contemplating images while remaining
<span class="locked">impassible.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></span> Ratiocination, opinion and thought,
which principally constitute <span class="locked">us,<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span> deal exclusively with
these images, by which the soul has the power of
directing the organism.</p>

<h3>DISTINCTION IN THE WHOLE ORGANISM.</h3>

<p>No doubt these faculties are "ours," but "we" are
the superior principle which, from above, directs the
organising but in this whole we shall have to distinguish
an inferior part, mingled with the body, and
a superior part, which is the true man. The former
(irrational soul) constitutes the beast, as for instance,
the lion; the latter is the rational soul, which constitutes
man. In every ratiocination, it is "we" who
reason, because ratiocination is the peculiar activity
(or, energy) of the soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1200" id="Page_1200">1200</a></span><a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<h3>INDIVIDUAL RELATION WITH COSMIC INTELLECT.</h3>

<p>8. What is our relation with the Intelligence? I
mean not the habit imparted to the soul by the intellect,
but the absolute <span class="locked">Intelligence;<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span> which, though
above us, is also common to all men, or peculiar to
each of them; in other words, is simultaneously common
and individual. Common because it is indivisible,
one and everywhere the same; particular because each
soul possesses it entirely in the first or rational soul.
Likewise, we possess the ideas in a double manner; in
the soul they appear developed and separate; in the
intelligence they exist all <span class="locked">together.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></span></p>

<h3>INDIVIDUAL RELATION WITH GOD AND COSMIC
SOUL.</h3>

<p>What is our relation with God? He hovers over the
intelligible nature, and real being; while we, being on
the third rank as counted from thence, are of the undivided
universal Soul, <span class="locked">which<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span> is indivisible because
she forms part of the upper world, while she is divisible
in regard to the bodies. She is indeed divisible in
regard to the bodies, since she permeates each of them
as far as they live; but at the same time she is indivisible
because she is one in the universe.</p>

<h3>SOUL GIVES LIFE TO PSYCHOLOGIC ELEMENTS.</h3>

<p>She seems to be present in the bodies, and illuminates
them, making living beings out of them. This
occurs not as a mixture of herself and bodies, but by
remaining individual, giving out images of <span class="locked">herself,<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></span>
just as a single face in several mirrors. Of these, the
first is sensation, which resides in the common part,
the organism; then come all the other forms of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1201" id="Page_1201">1201</a></span>
soul&mdash;forms which successively derive each from the
other, down to the faculties of generation and increase,
and generally, the power of producing and
fashioning that which is different from self&mdash;which
indeed the soul does as soon as she turns towards the
object she <span class="locked">fashions.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></span></p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF EVILS, SINS, AND ERRORS.</h3>

<p>9. In this conception of the soul, she will be foreign
to the cause of the evils which the man does and
suffers. These refer to the organism, that common
part, understood as above. Although opinion be deceptive,
and makes us commit much evil, and although
opinion and ratiocination both belong to the soul, yet
the soul may be sinless, inasmuch as we are only
mastered by the worse part of our <span class="locked">nature.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span> Often, indeed,
we yield to appetite, to anger, and we are the
dupes of some imperfect image. The conception of
false things, the <span class="locked">imagination<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span> does not await the judgment
of discursive reason. There are still other cases
where we yield to the lower part of ourselves; in sensation,
for instance, we see things that do not exist, because
we rely on the common sensation of soul and
body, before having discerned its objects by discursive
reason.</p>

<h3>INTELLECT DID NOT GRASP THE OBJECT ITSELF.</h3>

<p>In this case did the intellect grasp the object itself?
Certainly not; and, therefore, it is not the intellect
that is responsible for the error. We say as much for
the "we," according as we will or will not have perceived
the object, either in the intellect, or in ourselves;&mdash;for
it is possible to possess an object without
having it actually present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1202" id="Page_1202">1202</a></span></p>

<h3>TRUE CONCEPTION ACT OF INTUITION.</h3>

<p>We have distinguished from things common to soul
and body, those peculiar to the soul. The former are
corporeal, and cannot be produced without the organs,
while the latter's occurrence is independent of the body.
<span class="locked">Ratiocination<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span> is the essential and constitutive faculty
of the real soul, because it determines the typical forms
derived from sensation, it looks, it somehow feels the
images, and really is the dominating part of the soul.
The conception of true things is the act of intuitive
thoughts.</p>

<h3>MODIFICATIONS DERIVE FROM FOREIGN SOURCES.</h3>

<p>There is often a resemblance and community between
exterior and interior things; in this case the soul
will not any the less exercise herself on herself, will
not any the less remain within herself, without feeling
any passive modification. As to the modifications and
troubles which may arise in us, they derive from
foreign elements, attached to the soul, as well as from
passions experienced by the above described common
part.</p>

<h3>DISTINCTIONS IN "WE" AND THE "REAL MAN."</h3>

<p>10. But if "we" are the "soul," we must admit
that when we experience passions, the soul experiences
them also; that when we act, the soul acts. We may
even say that the common part is also "ours," especially
before philosophy separated the soul from the
<span class="locked">body;<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span> in fact, we even say "we" suffer, when our
body suffers. "We" is, therefore, taken in a double
sense: either the soul with the animal part, or living
body; or simply the upper part; while the vivified
body is a wild beast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1203" id="Page_1203">1203</a></span></p>

<h3>REAL MAN DIFFERS FROM BODY.</h3>

<p>The real Man differs from the body; pure from
every passion, he possesses the intellectual virtues,
virtues which reside in the soul, either when she is
separated from the body, or when she is&mdash;as usually
here below&mdash;only separable by philosophy; for even
when she seems to us entirely separated, the soul is, in
this life, ever accompanied by a <span class="locked">lower<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span> sensitive part,
or part of growth, which she <span class="locked">illuminates.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span></p>

<h3>FUNCTION OF THE COMMON PART.</h3>

<p>As to the virtues which consist not in wisdom, but
in ethical habits and austerities, they belong to the
common part. To it alone, also, are vices to be imputed,
inasmuch as it exclusively experiences envy,
jealousy and cowardly pity. Friendships, however,
should be referred some to the common part, and
others to the pure Soul or inner Man. In childhood,
the faculties of the composite common part are exercised,
but rarely is it illuminated from above. When
this superior principle seems inactive in relation to us,
it is actively engaged towards the upper intelligible
world; and it only begins to be active towards us when
it advances as far <span class="locked">as<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span> (fancy or representation), the
middle part of our being.</p>

<h3>THE SUPERIOR PRINCIPLE NOT ALWAYS UTILIZED.</h3>

<p>But is the superior principle not "ours" also? Surely,
but only when we are conscious thereof; for we do
not always utilize our possessions. This utilization,
however, takes place when we direct this middle part
of our being towards either the upper or lower worlds,
and when we actualize into energies what before was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1204" id="Page_1204">1204</a></span>
only an (Aristotelian) "potentiality" or a (Stoic)
"habit."</p>

<h3>THE ANIMATING PRINCIPLE OF ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>We might define the animating principle of animals.
If it be true, according to common opinion, that animal
bodies contain human souls that have sinned, the separable
part of these souls does not properly belong to
these bodies; although these souls assist these bodies,
the souls are not actually present to <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span> In them
the sensation is common to the image of the soul and
to the body;&mdash;but to the latter only in so far as it is
organized and fashioned by the image of the soul. As
to the animals into whose bodies no human soul entered,
they are produced by an illumination of the
universal Soul.</p>

<h3>THE SOUL BOTH IMPASSIBLE AND PUNISHABLE.</h3>

<p>12. There is a contradiction between our own
former opinion that the soul cannot sin, and the universally
admitted belief that the soul commits sins,
expiates them, undergoes punishments in Hades, and
that she passes into new bodies. Although we seem
to be in a dilemma, forcing us to choose between them,
it might be possible to show they are not incompatible.</p>

<h3>PHILOSOPHIC SEPARATION REFERS NOT ONLY TO
BODY, BUT TO PASSIBLE ACCRETIONS.</h3>

<p>When we attribute infallibility to the soul, we are
supposing her to be one and simple, identifying the
soul with soul essence. When, however, we consider
her capable of sin, we are looking at her as a complex,
of her essence and of another kind of soul which can
experience brutal passions. The soul, thus, is a combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1205" id="Page_1205">1205</a></span>
of various elements; and it is not the pure
soul, but this combination, which experiences passions,
commits sins, and undergoes punishments. It was this
conception of the soul Plato was referring to when he
<span class="locked">said:<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></span> "We see the soul as we see Glaucus, the
marine deity," and he adds, "He who would know the
nature of the soul herself should, after stripping her of
all that is foreign to her, in her, especially consider her
philosophic love for truth; and see to what things she
attaches herself, and by virtue of whose affinities she
is what she is." We must, therefore, differentiate the
soul's life acts from that which is punished, and when
we speak of philosophy's separation of the soul, we
mean a detaching not only from the body, but also
from what has been added to the soul.</p>

<h3>HOW THE ANIMAL NATURE IS GENERATED.</h3>

<p>This addition occurs during her generation, or
rather in the generation of another ideal form of soul,
the "animal nature." <span class="locked">Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></span> this generation has
been explained thus. When the soul descends, at the
very moment when she inclines towards the body, she
produces an image of herself. The soul, however,
must not be blamed for sending this image into the
body. For the soul to incline towards the body is for
the soul to shed light on what is below her; and this
is no more sinful than to produce a shadow. That
which is blamable is the illuminated object; for if it
did not exist, there would be nothing to illuminate.
The descent of the soul, or her inclination to the body,
means only that she communicates life to what she
illuminates. She drives away her image, or lets it
vanish, if nothing receptive is in its vicinity; the soul
lets the image vanish, not because she is separated&mdash;for
to speak accurately, she is not separated from the
body&mdash;but because she is no longer here below; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1206" id="Page_1206">1206</a></span>
she is no longer below when she is entirely occupied in
contemplating the intelligible world.</p>

<h3>THE DOUBLE HERCULES SYMBOLIZES THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>(Homer) seems to admit this distinction in speaking
of Hercules, when he sends the image of this hero into
Hades, and still he locates him within the abode of the
<span class="locked">deities<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></span>;&mdash;it is at least the idea implied in this double
assertion that Hercules is in Hades and that he is in
Olympus. The poet, therefore, distinguished in him
two elements. We might perhaps expound the passage
as follows: Hercules had an active virtue, and
because of his great qualities was judged worthy of
being classified with the deities, but as he possessed
only the active virtue, and not the contemplative virtue,
he could not be admitted into Heaven entirely;
while he is in heaven, there is something of him in
<span class="locked">Hades.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></span></p>

<h3>RELATION OF THE "WE" AND THE "SOUL."</h3>

<p>13. Is it "we" or the "soul" which makes these
researches? It is we, by means of the soul. The
cause of this is, not we who consider the soul because
we possess her, but that the soul considers herself.
This need not imply motion, as it is generally understood,
but a motion entirely different from that of the
bodies, and which is its own life.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE NOT OURS, BUT WE.</h3>

<p>Intelligence<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> also is ours, but only in the sense that
the soul is intelligent; for us, the (higher) life consists
in a better thinking. The soul enjoys this life either
when she thinks intelligible objects, or when the intellect
is both a part of ourselves, and something
superior towards which we ascend.</p>

<span class="smaller">Of the First Good, and of the Other <span class="locked">Goods.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></span></span></h2>

<h3>THE SUPREME GOOD AS END OF ALL OTHER GOODS.</h3>

<p>1. Could any one say that there was, for any being,
any good but the activity of "living according to nature?"<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a>
For a being composed of several parts, however,
the good will consist in the activity of its best
part, an action which is peculiar, natural, and unfailing.
Further: as the soul is an excellent being, and
directs her activity towards something excellent, this
excellent aim is not merely excellent relatively to the
soul, but is the absolute Good. If then there be a
principle which does not direct its action towards any
other thing, because it is the best of beings, being
above them all, it can be this only because all other
beings trend towards it. This then, evidently, is the
absolute Good by virtue of which all other beings participate
therein.</p>

<h3>PARTICIPATION IN GOOD. TWO METHODS.</h3>

<p>Now there are two methods of participation in the
Good: the first, is to become similar to it; the second
is to direct one's activity towards it. If then the direction
of one's desire and one's action towards the better
principle be a good, then can the absolute good itself
neither regard nor desire any other thing, remaining
in abiding rest, being the source and principle of all
actions conforming to nature, giving to other things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1209" id="Page_1209">1209</a></span>
the form of the Good, without acting on them, as
they, on the contrary, direct their actions thereto.</p>

<h3>PERMANENCE THE CHIEF NOTE OF ABSOLUTE GOOD.</h3>

<p>Only by permanence&mdash;not by action, nor even by
thought&mdash;is this principle the Good. For if it be super-Being,
it must also be super-Activity, super-Intelligence,
and Thought. The principle from which everything
depends, while itself depending on nothing else, must,
therefore, be recognized as the Good. (This divinity)
must, therefore, persist in His condition, while everything
turns towards Him, just as, in a circle, all the
radii meet in the centre. An example of this is the sun,
which is a centre of the light that is, as it were, suspended
from that planet. The light accompanies the
sun everywhere, and never parts from it; and even if
you wished to separate it on one side, it would not any
the less remain concentrated around it.</p>

<h3>ALL THINGS DEPEND ON THE GOOD BY UNITY,
ESSENCE, AND QUALITY.</h3>

<p>2. Let us study the dependence of everything on
the Good. The inanimate trends toward the Soul,
while the animate Soul trends towards the Good
through Intelligence. As far as anything possesses
unity, essence or form, it participates in the Good. By
its participation in unity, essence and form each being
participates in the Good, even though the latter be
only an image, for the things in which it participates are
only images of unity, essence, and form. For the (first)
<span class="locked">Soul<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></span> as she approaches Intelligence, she acquires a
life which approaches closer to truth; and she owes
this to Intelligence; thus (by virtue of Intelligence)
she possesses the form of the Good. To possess the
latter, all she needs to do is to turn her looks towards it;
for Intelligence is the next after the Good. Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1210" id="Page_1210">1210</a></span>
to those to whom it is granted to live, life is the good.
Likewise, for those who participate in intelligence,
Intelligence is the good. Consequently, such (a being
as) joins intelligence to life possesses a double good.</p>

<h3>THERE IS NO UNALLOYED EVIL FOR THE LIVING
BEING.</h3>

<p>3. Though life be a good, it does not belong to all
beings. Life is incomplete for the evil person, as for
an eye that does not see distinctly; neither accomplish
their purpose. If, for us, life, though mingled as
it is, be a good, even if an imperfect one, how shall we
continue to assert that death is not an evil? But for
whom would it be an evil? This we must ask because
evil must necessarily be an attribute of somebody.
Now there is no more evil for a being which, though
even existing, is deprived of life, any more than for a
stone (as they say). But if, after death, the being
still live, if it be still animate, it will possess good, and
so much the more as it exercises its faculties without
the body. If it be united to the universal Soul, evidently
there can be no evil for it, any more than for
the gods who possess good unmingled with evil.
Similar is the case of the soul which preserves her
purity, inasmuch as he who loses her finds that life,
and not death, is the real Evil. If there be chastisements
in Hades, again is life an evil for the soul, because
she is not pure. If, further, we define life as
the union of the soul with the body, and death as their
separation, the soul can pass through both these conditions
(without, on that account, being unhappy, or
losing her hold on the Good).</p>

<h3>BY VIRTUE, LIFE CHANGES FROM AN EVIL TO A
GOOD.</h3>

<p>How is death not an evil, if life be a good? Certainly
life is a good for such as possess the Good, (it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1211" id="Page_1211">1211</a></span>
is a good) not because the soul is united to the body,
but because she repels evil by virtue. (Without the
latter) death would rather be a good (because it delivers
us from the <span class="locked">body<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></span>). To resume: by itself, life
in a body is evil; but, by virtue, the soul locates herself
in the good, not by perpetuating the existing corporeal
union, but by separating herself from the body.</p>

<span class="smaller">Of Virtues.</span></h2>

<p>I.&mdash;There is a difference between the virtues of the
citizen, those of the man who essays to rise to contemplation,
and who, on this account, is said to possess a
contemplative mind; those of him who contemplates
intelligence; and finally those of pure Intelligence,
which is completely separated from the soul.</p>

<p>1. The civil virtues consist of moderation in passions,
and in letting one's actions follow the rational
laws of duty. The object of these virtues being to
make us benevolent in our dealings with our fellow-human
beings, they are called civil virtues because
they mutually unite citizens. "Prudence refers to the
rational part of our soul; courage, to that part of the
soul subject to anger; temperance consists in the agreement
and harmony of appetite and reason; finally justice,
consists in the accomplishment, by all these faculties,
of the function proper to each of them, either to
command, or to obey."</p>

<p>2. The virtues of the man who tries to rise to contemplation
consist in detaching oneself from things
here below; that is why they are called <span class="locked">"purifications."<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></span>
They command us to abstain from activities
which innervate the organs, and which excite the affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1216" id="Page_1216">1216</a></span>
that relate to the body. The object of these virtues
is to raise the soul to genuine existence. While
the civil virtues are the ornament of mortal life, and
prepare the soul for the purificatory virtues, the latter
direct the man whom they adorn to abstain from activities
in which the body predominates. Thus, in the
purificatory virtues, "prudence consists in not forming
opinions in harmony with the body, but in acting by
oneself, which is the work of pure thought. Temperance
consists in not sharing the passions of the body;
courage, in not fearing separation therefrom, as if
death drove man into emptiness and annihilation;
while justice exacts that reason and intelligence command
and be obeyed." The civil virtues moderate the
passions; their object is to teach us to live in conformity
with the laws of human nature. The contemplative
virtues obliterate the passions from the soul; their
object is to assimilate man to the divinity.</p>

<p>There is a difference between purifying oneself, and
being pure. Consequently the purificatory virtues may,
like purification itself, be considered in two lights;
they purify the soul, and they adorn the purified soul,
because the object of purification is purity. But
"since purification and purity consist in being separated
from every foreign entity, the good is something different
from the soul that purifies itself. If the soul
that purifies herself had possessed the good before losing
her purity, it would be sufficient for the soul to
purify herself; but in this very case, what would remain
to her after the purification would be the good,
but not the purification. But the soul is not the good;
she can only participate therein, and have its form;
otherwise the soul would not have fallen into evil. For
the soul, good consists in being united to her author,
and her evil is to unite with lower <span class="locked">things."<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></span></p>

<p>Of evil, there are two kinds; the one, is to unite with
lower things; the other is to abandon oneself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1217" id="Page_1217">1217</a></span>
passions. The civil virtues owe their name of virtues
and their value to their releasing the soul from one of
these two kinds of evil (of the passions). The purificatory
virtues are superior to the former, in that they
free the soul from her characteristic form of evil (that
is, union with lower things). Therefore, when the
soul is pure, she must be united to her author; her virtue,
after her "conversion," consists in her knowledge
and science of veritable existence; not that the soul
lacks this knowledge, but because without her superior
principle, without intelligence, she does not see what
she <span class="locked">possesses.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></span></p>

<p>3. There is a third kind of virtues, which are superior
to the civil and purificatory virtues, the "virtues
of the soul that contemplates intelligence." "Here
prudence and wisdom consist in contemplating the
"beings" or essences contained by intelligence; justice
consists in the soul's fulfilling of her characteristic
function; that is, in attaching herself to intelligence and
to direct her activity thither. Temperance is the intimate
conversion of the soul towards Intelligence,
while courage is the impassibility by which the soul
becomes assimilated to what she contemplates, since
the soul's nature is to be <span class="locked">impassible.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></span> These virtues
are as intimately concatenated as the other (lower
forms)."</p>

<p>4. There is a fourth kind of virtues, the "exemplary virtues,"
which reside within intelligence. Their
superiority to the virtues of the soul is the same as that
of the type to the image; for intelligence contains simultaneously
all the "beings" or essences which are
the types of lower things. "Within intelligence, prudence
is the science; wisdom is the thought, temperance
is the conversion towards oneself; justice is the accomplishment
of one's characteristic function; courage is
the identity of intelligence, its perseverance in purity,
concentrated within itself, in virtue of its superiority."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1218" id="Page_1218">1218</a></span>327</p>

<p>We thus have four kinds of virtues: 1, the exemplary
virtues, characteristic of intelligence, and of the "being"
or nature to which they belong; 2, the virtues of
the soul turned towards intelligence, and filled with
her contemplation; 3, the virtues of the soul that
purifies herself, or which has purified herself from the
brutal passions characteristic of the body; 4, the virtues
that adorn the man by restraining within narrow
limits the action of the irrational part, and by moderating
the passions. "He who possesses the virtues of
the superior order necessarily (potentially) possesses
the inferior virtues. But the converse does not <span class="locked">occur."<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></span>
"He who possesses the superior virtues will
not prefer to practice the lower virtues because of the
mere possession thereof; he will practice them only
when circumstances will invite (it). The objects, indeed,
differ with the kind of virtues. The object of the
civil virtues is to moderate our passions so as to conform
our conduct to the laws of human nature. That
of the purificatory virtues is to detach the soul completely
from the passions. That of the contemplative
virtues is to apply the soul to intellectual operations,
even to the extent of no longer having to think of the
need of freeing oneself from the passions. Last, that
of the exemplary virtues is similar to that of the other
virtues. Thus the practical virtues make man virtuous;
the purificatory virtues make man divine, or make of
the good man, a protecting deity; the contemplative
virtues deify; while the exemplary virtues make a man
the parent of divinities. We should specially apply
ourselves to purificatory virtues believing that we
can acquire them even in this life; and that possession
of them leads to superior virtues. We must push purification
as far as possible, as it consists in separating
(the soul) from the body, and in freeing oneself from
any passional movement of the irrational part. But
how can one purify the soul? To what limit may purification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1219" id="Page_1219">1219</a></span>
be pushed? These are two questions that demand
examination.</p>

<p>To begin with, the foundation of purification is to
know oneself, to realize that he is a soul bound to a
foreign being, of a different nature (or, "being").</p>

<p>Further, when one is convinced of this truth, one
should gather oneself together within himself, detaching
himself from the body, and freeing himself entirely
from the passions. He who makes use of his senses
too often, though it be done without devotion or pleasure,
is, nevertheless, distracted by the care of the body,
and is chained thereto by sensation. The pains and
the pleasures produced by sense-objects exercise a
great influence on the soul, and inspire the soul with
an inclination for the body. It is important to remove
such a disposition from the soul. "To achieve this
purpose, the soul will allow the body only necessary
pleasures, that serve to cure her of her sufferings, to
refresh her from her exhaustions, to hinder her from
being importunate. The soul will free herself from
<span class="locked">pains;<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></span> if this be beyond her powers, the soul will support
them patiently, and will diminish them, while
refusing to share them. The soul will appease anger
so far as possible; she will even try to suppress them
entirely; at least, if that be impossible, she will not
voluntarily participate therein, leaving the non-reflective
excitement to another (animal) nature, reducing
the involuntary motions as far as possible. The soul
will be inaccessible to fear&mdash;having nothing further
to risk; even so, she will restrain every sudden movement;
she will pay attention to fear only insofar as it
may be nature's warning at the approach of danger.
Absolutely nothing shameful will be desired; in eating
and drinking, she will seek only the satisfaction of a
need, while remaining essentially alien thereto. The
pleasures of love will not even involuntarily be tasted,
at least, she will not allow herself to be drawn beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1220" id="Page_1220">1220</a></span>
the flights of fancy that occur in dreams. In the purified
man, the intellectual part of the soul will be pure
of all these passions. She will even desire that the
part that experiences the irrational passions of the
body should take notice of them without being agitated
thereby, and without yielding to them. In this way, if
the irrational part should itself happen to experience
emotions, the latter will be promptly calmed by the
presence of reason. Struggles will have been left behind
before any headway will have been made to purification.
The presence of reason will suffice; the inferior
principle, indeed, will respect the higher one to the
extent of being angry with itself, and reproaching itself
for weakness, in case it feels any agitation that disturbs
its master's rest." So long as the soul experiences
even moderate passions, the soul's progress towards
impassibility remains in need of improvement. The
soul is impassible only when she has entirely ceased to
participate in the passions of the body. Indeed, that
which permitted the passions to rule was that reason
relaxed the reins as a result of her own inclination.</p>

<h3>OF THE CONCEPTION OF MATTER (10).</h3>

<p>4. While separating ourselves from existence we
by thought beget nonentity (matter). While remaining
united with existence, we also conceive of nonentity
(the one). Consequently, when we separate
ourselves from existence, we do not conceive of the
nonentity which is above existence (the one), but we
beget by thought something that is deceptive, and we
put ourselves in the condition (of indetermination) in
which one is when outside of oneself. Just as each
one can really, and by himself, raise himself to the
non-existence which is above existence (the One); so
(by separating oneself from existence by thought), we
may reach the nonentity beneath existence.</p>

<h2 class="vspace">THIRD ENNEAD, BOOK SIX.<br />

<span class="smaller">Of the Impassibility of Incorporeal Things.</span></h2>

<h3>OF THE INCORPOREAL (3).</h3>

<p>5. The name "incorporeal" does not designate
one and the same genus, as does the word "body."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1222" id="Page_1222">1222</a></span>
Incorporeal entities derive their name from the fact
that they are conceived of by abstraction from the
body. Consequently, some of them (like intelligence
and discursive reason) are genuine beings, existing as
well without as within the body, subsisting by themselves,
by themselves being actualizations and lives;
other beings (such as matter, sense-form without matter,
place, time, and so forth), do not constitute real
beings, but are united to the body, and depend therefrom,
live through others, possess only a relative life,
and exist only through certain actualizations. Indeed,
when we apply to them the name of incorporeal entities
(it is merely a negative designation), indicating
only what they are not, but not what they are.</p>

<h3>OF THE IMPASSIBILITY OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>6. (1) The soul is a "being" or essence, without
extension, immaterial and incorruptible; her nature
consists in a life which is life in itself.</p>

<p>7. (3, end) When the existence of some being
is life itself, and when the passions are lives, its death
consists in a life of a certain nature, and not in entire
privation of life; for the "passion" experienced by this
"being" or essence, does not force it into complete
loss of life.</p>

<p>8. (2, 3) There is a difference between the affections
of the bodies, and those of incorporeal things.
The affection of bodies consists in change. On the
contrary, the affections and experiences characteristic
of the soul are actualizations that have nothing in common
with the cooling or heating up of the bodies.
Consequently if, for bodies, an affection ever implies
a change, we may say that all incorporeal (beings)
are impassible. Indeed, immaterial and incorporeal
beings are always identical in their actualization; but
those that impinge on matter and bodies, though in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1223" id="Page_1223">1223</a></span>
themselves impassible, allow the subjects in which
they reside to be affected. So when an animal feels,
the soul resembles a harmony separated from its instrument,
which itself causes the vibration of the
strings that have been tuned to unison herewith; while
the body resembles a harmony inseparable from the
strings. The reason why the soul moves the living
being is that the latter is animated. We, therefore,
find an analogy between the soul and the musician who
causes his instrument to produce sounds because he
himself contains a harmonic power. The body, struck
by a sense-impression, resembles strings tuned in
unison. In the production of sound, it is not the harmony
itself but the string that is affected. The
musician causes it to resound because he contains a
harmonic power. Nevertheless, in spite of the will of
the musician, the instrument would produce no harmonies
that conformed to the laws of music, unless
harmony itself dictated them.</p>

<p>9. (5) The soul binds herself to the body by a
conversion toward the affections experienced by the
body. She detaches herself from the body by
"apathy," (turning away from the body's affections.)</p>

<h3>OF THE IMPASSIBILITY OF MATTER.</h3>

<p>10. (7) According to the ancient (sages) such
are the properties of matter. "Matter is incorporeal
because it differs from bodies. Matter is not lifeless,
because it is neither intelligence, nor soul, nor anything
that lives by itself. It is formless, variable, infinite,
impotent; consequently, matter cannot be
existence, but nonentity. Of course it is not nonentity
in the same way that movement is nonentity; matter
is nonentity really. It is an image and a phantom of
extension, because it is the primary substrate of extension.
It is impotence, and the desire for existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1224" id="Page_1224">1224</a></span>
The only reason that it persists is not rest (but
change); it always seems to contain contraries, the
great and small, the less and more, lack and excess.
It is always "becoming," without ever persisting in its
condition, or being able to come out of it. Matter is
the lack of all existence; and, consequently, what matter
seems to be is a deception. If, for instance, matter
seems to be large, it really is small; like a mere phantom,
it escapes and evanesces into nonentity, not by
any change of place, but by its lack of reality. Consequently,
the substrate of the images in matter consists
of a lower image. That in which objects present
appearances that differ according to their positions is
a mirror, a mirror that seems crowded, though it possesses
nothing, and which yet seems to be everything."</p>

<h3>OF THE PASSIBILITY OF THE BODY (8&ndash;19).</h3>

<p>11. Passions (or, affections) refer to something
destructible; for it is passion that leads to destruction;
it is the same sort of being that can be affected, and
can be destroyed. Incorporeal entities, however, are
not subject to destruction; they either exist or not; in
either case they are non-affectible. That which can
be affected need not have this impassible nature, but
must be subject to alteration or destruction by the
qualities of things that enter into it and affect it; for
that which in it subsists is not altered by the first chance
entity. Consequently, matter is impassible, as by itself
it possesses no quality. The forms that enter into
and issue from matter (as a substrate) are equally
impassible. That which is affected is the composite
of form and matter, whose existence consists in the
union of these two elements; for it is evidently subject
to the action of contrary powers, and of the qualities
of things which enter into it, and affect it. That is
why the beings that derive their existence from something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1225" id="Page_1225">1225</a></span>
else, instead of possessing it by themselves, can
likewise by virtue of their passivity, either live or not.
On the contrary, the beings whose existence consists
in an impassible life necessarily live permanently; likewise
the things that do not live are equally impassible
inasmuch as they do not live. Consequently, being
changed and being affected refer only to the composite
of form and matter, to the body, and not to matter.
Likewise, to receive life and to lose it, to feel passions
that are its consequence, can refer only to the composite
of soul and body. Nothing similar could happen
to the soul; for she is not something compounded out
of life and lifelessness; she is life itself, because her
"being" or nature is simple, and is automatic.</p>

<h3>OF THOUGHT.</h3>

<p>12. (1) Thought is not the same everywhere; it
differs according to the nature of every "being." In
intelligence, it is intellectual; in the soul it is rational;
in the plant it is seminal; last, it is superior to intelligence
and existence in the principle that surpasses all
these.</p>

<h3>OF LIFE.</h3>

<p>13. (7) The word "body" is not the only one
that may be taken in different senses; such is also the
case with "life." There is a difference between the
life of the plant, of the animal, of the soul, of intelligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1226" id="Page_1226">1226</a></span>
and of super-intelligence. Indeed, intelligible
entities are alive though the things that proceed
therefrom do not possess a life similar to theirs.</p>

<h3>OF THE ONE.</h3>

<p>14. (8) By (using one's) intelligence one may
say many things about the super-intellectual (principle).
But it can be much better viewed by an absence
of thought, than by thought. This is very much
the same case as that of sleep, of which one can speak,
up to a certain point, during the condition of wakefulness;
but of which no knowledge of perception can be
acquired except by sleeping. Indeed, like is known
only by like; the condition of all knowledge is for the
subject to be assimilated to the <span class="locked">subject.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace">FOURTH ENNEAD, BOOK TWO.<br />

<span class="smaller">Of the Nature of the Soul.</span></h2>

<p>15. (1) Every body is in a place; the incorporeal
in itself is not in a place, any more than the things
which have the same nature as it.</p>

<p>16. (1) The incorporeal in itself, by the mere
fact of its being superior to every body and to every
place, is present everywhere without occupying extension,
in an indivisible manner.</p>

<p>17. (1) The incorporeal in itself, not being present
to the body in a local manner, is present to the
body whenever it pleases, that is, by inclining towards
it so far as it is within its nature to do so. Not being
present to the body in a local manner, it is present to
the body by its disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1227" id="Page_1227">1227</a></span>
18. (1) The incorporeal in itself does not become
present to the body in "being" nor in hypostatic form
of existence. It does not mingle with the body.
Nevertheless, by its inclination to the body, it begets
and communicates to it a potentiality capable of uniting
with the body. Indeed the inclination of the incorporeal
constitutes a second nature (the irrational
soul), which unites with the body.</p>

<p>19. (1) The soul has a nature intermediary between
the "being" that is indivisible, and the "being"
that is divisible by its union with the bodies. Intelligence
is a "being" absolutely indivisible; the bodies
alone are divisible; but the qualities and the forms
engaged in matter are divisible by their union with the
bodies.</p>

<p>20. (2) The things that act upon others do not
act by approximation and by contact. It is only accidentally
when this occurs (that they act by proximity
and contact).</p>

<h2 class="vspace">FOURTH ENNEAD, BOOK THREE.<br />

<span class="smaller">Problems About the Soul.</span></h2>

<h3>UNION OF THE SOUL AND THE BODY.</h3>

<p>21. (20) The hypostatic substance of the body
does not hinder the incorporeal in itself from being
where and as it wishes; for just as that which is non-extended
cannot be contained by the body, so also that
which has extension forms no obstacle for the incorporeal,
and in relation to it is as nonentity. The incorporeal
does not transport itself where it wishes by
a change of place; for only extended substance occupies
a place. Neither is the incorporeal compressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1228" id="Page_1228">1228</a></span>
by the body; for only that which is extended can be
compressed and displaced. That which has neither
extension nor magnitude, could not be hindered by
that which has extension, nor be exposed to a change
of place. Being everywhere and nowhere, the incorporeal,
wherever it happens to be, betrays its presence
only by a certain kind of disposition. It is by this
disposition that it rises above heaven, or descends into
a corner of the world. Not even this residence makes
it visible to our eyes. It is only by its works that it
manifests its presence.</p>

<p>22. (21&ndash;24) If the incorporeal be contained within
the body, it is not contained within it like an animal
in a zoölogical garden; for it can neither be included
within, nor embraced by the body. Nor is it, compressed
like water or air in a bag of skins. It produces
potentialities which from within its unity (?) radiate
outwards; it is by them that it descends into the body
and penetrates <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></span> It is by this indescribable extension
of itself that it enters into the body, and shuts itself
up within it. Except itself nothing retains it. It is
not the body that releases the incorporeal as result of
a lesion, or of its decay; it is the incorporeal that detaches
itself by turning away from the passions of the
body.</p>

<h3>OF THE DESCENT OF THE SOUL INTO THE BODY,
AND OF THE SPIRIT.</h3>

<p>23. (9) Just as "being on the earth," for the
soul, is not to tread on the ground, as does the body,
but only to preside over the body that treads on the
ground; likewise, "to be in hell" for the soul, is to
preside over an image whose nature is to be in a place,
and to have an obscure hypostatic form of existence.
That is why if the subterranean hell be a dark place,
the soul, without separating from existence, descends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1229" id="Page_1229">1229</a></span>
into hell when she attaches herself to some image. Indeed,
when the soul abandons the solid body over which
she presided she remains united to the spirit which she
has received from the celestial spheres. Since, as a result
of her affection for matter, she has developed particular
faculties by virtue of which she had a sympathetic
habit for some particular body during life, as a
result of this disposition, she impresses a form on the
spirit by the power of her imagination, and thus she
acquires an image. The soul is said to be in hell because
the spirit that surrounds her also happens to have
a formless and obscure nature; and as the heavy and
moistened spirit descends down into subterranean localities,
the soul is said to descend underground. Not indeed
that the very "being" of the soul changes place,
or is in a locality, but because she contracts the habits
of the bodies whose nature it is to change location, and
to be located somewhere. That is why the soul according
to her disposition, acquires some one body rather
than some other; for the rank and the special characteristics
of the body into which she enters depend on her
disposition.</p>

<p>Therefore, when in a condition of superior purity,
she unites with a body that is close to immaterial nature,
that is, an ethereal body. When she descends from the
development of reason to that of the imagination, she
receives a solar body. If she becomes effeminate, and
falls in love with forms, she puts on a lunar body.
Finally, when she falls into the terrestrial bodies, which,
resembling her shapeless character, are composed of
moist vapors, there results for her a complete ignorance
of existence, a sort of eclipse, and a veritable childhood.
When the soul leaves an earthly body, having her
spirit still troubled by these moist vapors, she develops
a shadow that weights her down; for a spirit of this kind
naturally tends to descend into the depths of the earth,
unless it be held up and raised by a higher cause. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1230" id="Page_1230">1230</a></span>
as the soul is attached to the earth by her earthly vesture,
so the moist spirit(ual body) to which the soul is
united makes her drag after her an image which weights
down the soul. The soul surrounds herself with moist
vapors when she mingles with a nature that in its operations
is moist or subterranean. But if the soul
separate from this nature, immediately around her
shines a dry light, without shade or shadow. In fact it
is humidity which forms clouds in the air; the dryness
of the atmosphere produces a dry and serene clearness.</p>

<span class="smaller">Of Sensation and Memory.</span></h2>

<h3>OF SENSATION.</h3>

<p>24. (3) The soul contains the reasons of all
things. The soul operates according to these reasons,
whether incited to activity by some exterior object, or
whether the soul be turned towards these reasons by
folding back on herself. When the soul is incited to
this activity by some exterior object, she applies her
senses thereto; when she folds back on herself, she
applies herself to thoughts. It might be objected that
the result is that there is neither sensation nor thought
without imagination; for just as in the animal part, no
sensation occurs without an impression produced on
the organs of sense; likewise there is no thought without
imagination. Certainly, an analogy obtains between
both cases. Just as the sense-image (type) results
from the impression experienced by sensation,
likewise the intellectual image (phantasm) results from
thought.</p>

<h3>OF THE PROCESSION OF BEINGS.</h3>

<p>26. When incorporeal hypostatic substances descend,
they split up and multiply, their power weakening
as they apply themselves to the individual. When,
on the contrary, they rise, they simplify, unite, and
their power intensifies.</p>

<p>27. In the life of incorporeal entities, the procession
operates in a manner such that the superior principle
remains firm and substantial in its nature, imparting
its existence to what is below it, without losing
anything, or transforming itself into anything. Thus
that which receives existence does not receive existence
with decay or alteration; it is not begotten like generation
(that is, the being of sense), which participates in
decay and change. It is, therefore, non-begotten and
incorruptible, because it is produced without generation
or corruption.</p>

<p>28. Every begotten thing derives the cause of its
generation from some other (being); for nothing is
begotten causelessly. But, among begotten things,
those which owe their being to a union of elements are
on that very account perishable. As to those which,
not being composite, owe their being to the simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1232" id="Page_1232">1232</a></span>
of their hypostatic substances, they are imperishable,
inasmuch as they are indissoluble. When we say that
they are begotten, we do not mean that they are composite,
but only that they depend on some cause. Thus
bodies are begotten doubly, first because they depend
on a cause, and then because they are composite. Souls
and intelligence, indeed, are begotten in the respect
that they depend on a cause; but not in the respect that
they are composite. Therefore, bodies, being doubly
begotten, are dissoluble and perishable. The Soul and
Intelligence, being unbegotten in the sense that they are
not composite, are indissoluble and imperishable; for
they are begotten only in the sense that they depend
on a cause.</p>

<p>29. Every principle that generates, by virtue of its
"being," is superior to the product it generates. Every
generated being naturally turns towards its generating
principle. Of the generating principles, some (the
universal and perfect substances) do not turn towards
their product; while others (the substances that are
individual, and subject to conversion towards the
manifold) partly turn towards their product, and remain
partly turned towards themselves; while others
entirely turn towards their product, and do not turn at
all towards themselves.</p>

<h3>OF THE RETURN OF BEINGS TO THE FIRST.</h3>

<p>30. Of the universal and perfect hypostatic substances,
none turns towards its product. All perfect
hypostatic substances return to the principles that generated
them. The very body of the world, by the
mere fact of its perfection, is converted to the intelligent
Soul, and that is the cause of its motion being circular.
The Soul of the world is converted to Intelligence,
and this to the <span class="locked">First.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></span> All beings, therefore,
aspire to the First, each in the measure of its ability,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1233" id="Page_1233">1233</a></span>
from the very lowest in the ranks of the universe up.
This anagogical return of beings to the First is necessary,
whether it be mediate or immediate. So we may
say that beings not only aspire to the First, but that
each being enjoys the First according to its <span class="locked">capacity.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></span>
The individual hypostatic substances, however, that are
subject to declining towards manifoldness, naturally
turn not only towards their author, but also towards
their product. That is the cause of (any subsequent)
fall and unfaithfulness. Matter perverts them because
they possess the possibility of inclining towards it,
though they are also able to turn towards the divinity.
That is how perfection makes second rank beings be
born of the first principles, and then be converted
towards them. It is, on the contrary, the result of
imperfection, to turn higher entities to lower things,
inspiring them with love for that which, before them,
withdrew from the first principles (in favor of matter).</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE KNOWS ITSELF BY A CONVERSION
TO HERSELF.</h3>

<p>31. (1) When one being subsists by dependence
on any other, and not by self-dependence and withdrawal
from any other, it could not turn itself towards
itself to know itself by separating from (the substrate)
by which it subsists. By withdrawing from its own
existence it would alter and perish. But when one being
cognizes itself by withdrawal from that to which it is
united, when it grasps itself as independent of that
being, and succeeds in doing so without exposing itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1234" id="Page_1234">1234</a></span>
to destruction, it evidently does not derive its "being"
or nature from the being from which it can, without
perishing, withdraw, to face itself, and know itself
independently. If sight, and in general all sensation
do not feel itself, nor perceive itself on separating from
the body, and do not subsist by itself; if, on the contrary,
intelligence think better by separating from the
body, and can be converted to itself without perishing,
evidently sense-faculties are actualized only by help of
the body, while intelligence actualizes and exists by itself,
and not by the body.</p>

<h3>THE ACTUALIZATION OF INTELLIGENCE IS ETERNAL
AND INDIVISIBLE.</h3>

<p>32. (3, 5&ndash;7) There is a difference between intelligence
and the intelligible, between sensation and that
which can be sensed. The intelligible is united to intelligence
as that which can be sensed is connected
with sensation. But sensation cannot perceive itself....
As the intelligible is united to Intelligence,
it is grasped by intelligence and not by sensation. But
intelligence is intelligible for intelligence. Since then
intelligence is intelligible for intelligence, intelligence is
its own object. If intelligence be intelligible, but not
"sensible," it is an intelligible object. Being intelligible
by intelligence, but not by sensation, it will be intelligent.
Intelligence, therefore, is simultaneously thinker
and thought, all that thinks and all that is thought. Its
operation, besides, is not that of an object that rubs and
is rubbed: "It is not a subject in some one part of
itself, and in some other, object of thought; it is simple,
it is entirely intelligible for itself as a <span class="locked">whole."<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></span> The
whole of intelligence excludes any idea of unintelligence.
It does not contain one part that thinks, while
another would not think; for then, in so far as it would
not think, "it would be unintelligent." It does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1235" id="Page_1235">1235</a></span>
abandon one object to think of another; for it would
cease to think the object it abandoned. If, therefore,
intelligence do not successively pass from one object
to another, it thinks simultaneously; it does not think
first one (thought) and then another; it thinks everything
as in the present, and as always....</p>

<p>If intelligence think everything as at present, if it
know no past nor future, its thought is a simple actualization,
which excludes every interval of time. It,
therefore, contains everything together, in respect to
time. Intelligence, therefore, thinks, all things according
to unity, and in unity, without anything falling in
in time or in space. If so, intelligence is not discursive,
and is not (like the soul) in motion; it is an actualization,
which is according to unity, and in unity, which
shuns all chance development and every discursive
<span class="locked">operation.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></span> If, in intelligence, manifoldness be reduced
to unity, and if the intellectual actualization be
indivisible, and fall not within time, we shall have to
attribute to such a "being" eternal existence in unity.
Now that happens to be "aeonial" or everlasting <span class="locked">existence.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></span>
Therefore, eternity constitutes the very
"being" (or nature) of intelligence. The other kind
of intelligence, that does not think according to unity,
and in unity, which falls into change, and into movement,
which abandons one object to think another,
which divides, and gives itself up to a discursive action,
has time as "being" (or nature).</p>

<p>The distinction of past and future suits its action.
When passing from one object to another, the soul
changes thoughts; not indeed that the former perish, or
that the latter suddenly issue from some other source;
but the former, while seeming to have disappeared,
remain in the soul; and the latter, while seeming to
come from somewhere else, do not really do so, but
are born from within the soul, which moves only from
one object to another, and which successively directs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1236" id="Page_1236">1236</a></span>
her gaze from one to another part of what she possesses.
She resembles a spring which, instead of flowing
outside, flows back into itself in a circle. It is this
(circular) movement of the soul that constitutes time,
just as the permanence of intelligence in itself constitutes
(aeonial) eternity. Intelligence is not separated
from eternity, any more than the soul is from time.
Intelligence and eternity form but a single hypostatic
form of existence. That which moves simulates eternity
by the indefinite perpetuity of its movement, and
that which remains immovable, simulates time by
seeming to multiply its continual present, in the measure
that time passes. That is why some have believed
that time manifested in rest as well as in movement,
and that eternity was no more than the infinity of time.
To each of these two (different things) the attributes
of the other were mistakenly attributed. The reason
of this is that anything that ever persists in an identical
movement gives a good illustration of eternity by the
continuousness of its movement; while that which
persists in an identical actualization represents time by
the permanence of its actualization. Besides, in sense-objects,
duration differs according to each of them.
There is a difference between the duration of the
course of the sun, and that of the moon, as well as that
of Venus, and so on. There is a difference between
the solar year, and the year of each of these stars.
Different, further, is the year that embraces all the
other years, and which conforms to the movement of
the soul, according to which the stars regulate their
movements. As the movement of the soul differs from
the movement of the stars, so also does its time differ
from that of the stars; for the divisions of this latter
kind of time correspond to the spaces travelled by
each star, and by its successive passages in different
places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1237" id="Page_1237">1237</a></span></p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE IS MANIFOLD.</h3>

<p>33. (10&ndash;12) Intelligence is not the principle of
all things; for it is manifold. Now the manifold presupposes
the One. Evidently, it is intelligence that is
manifold; the intelligibles that it thinks do not form
unity, but manifoldness, and they are identical therewith.
Therefore, since intelligence and the intelligible
entities are identical, and as the intelligible entities
form a manifoldness, intelligence itself is manifold.</p>

<p>The identity of intelligence and of intelligible entities
may be demonstrated as follows. The object
that intelligence contemplates must be in it, or exist
outside of itself. It is, besides, evident, that intelligence
contemplates; since, for intelligence, to think is
to be <span class="locked">intelligence,<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></span> therefore, to abstract its thought
would be to deprive it of its "being." This being
granted, we must determine in what manner intelligence
contemplates its object. We shall accomplish
this by examining the different faculties by which we
acquire various kinds of knowledge, namely, sensation,
imagination and intelligence.</p>

<p>The principle which makes use of the senses contemplates
only by grasping exterior things, and far
from uniting itself to the objects of its contemplation,
from this perception it gathers no more than an image.
Therefore when the eye sees the visible object, it cannot
identify itself with this object; for it would not see
it, unless it were at a certain distance therefrom. Likewise
if the object of touch confused itself with the
organ that touches it, it would disappear. Therefore
the senses, and the principle that makes use of the
senses, apply themselves to what is outside of them to
perceive this sense-object.</p>

<p>Likewise imagination applies its attention to what is
outside of it to form for itself an image of it; it is by
this very attention to what is outside of it that it represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1238" id="Page_1238">1238</a></span>
to itself the object of which it forms an image as
exterior.</p>

<p>That is how sensation and imagination perceive their
objects. Neither of these two faculties folds itself
back on itself, nor concentrates on itself, whether the
object of their perception be a corporeal or incorporeal
form.</p>

<p>Not in this manner is intelligence perceived; this can
occur only by turning towards itself, and by contemplating
itself. If it left the contemplation of its own
actualizations, if it ceased to be their contemplation
(or, intuition), it would no longer think anything.
Intelligence perceives the intelligible entity as sensation
perceives the sense-object, by intuition. But in
order to contemplate the sense-object, sensation applies
to what is outside of it, because its object is material.
On the contrary, in order to contemplate the intelligible
entity, intelligence concentrates in itself, instead
of applying itself to what is outside of it. That is why
some philosophers have thought that there was only
a nominal difference between intelligence and imagination;
for they believed that intelligence was the imagination
of the reasonable animal; as they insisted that
everything should depend on matter and on corporeal
nature, they naturally had to make intelligence also
depend therefrom. But our intelligence contemplates
natures (or, "beings"). Therefore, (according to the
hypothesis of these philosophers) our intelligence will
contemplate these natures as located in some place.
But these natures are outside of matter; consequently,
they could not be located in any place. It is therefore
evident that the intelligible entities had to be posited as
within intelligence.</p>

<p>If the intelligible entities be within intelligence, intelligence
will contemplate intelligible entities and will
contemplate itself while contemplating them; by understanding
itself, it will think, because it will understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1239" id="Page_1239">1239</a></span>
intelligible entities. Now intelligible entities
form a multitude, <span class="locked">for<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></span> intelligence thinks a multitude
of intelligible entities, and not a unity; therefore, intelligence
is manifold. But manifoldness presupposes
unity; consequently, above intelligence, the existence
of unity will be necessary.</p>

<p>34. (5) Intellectual being is composed of similar
parts, so that existing beings exist both in individual
intelligence, and in universal Intelligence. But, in universal
Intelligence, individual (entities) are themselves
conceived universally; while in individual intelligence,
universal beings as well as individual beings are conceived
individually.</p>

<h3>OF THE INCORPOREAL.</h3>

<p>35. The incorporeal is that which is conceived of
by abstraction of the body; that is the derivation of its
name. To this genus, according to ancient sages, belong
matter, sense-form, when conceived of apart from
matter, natures, faculties, place, time, and surface. All
these entities, indeed, are called incorporeal because
they are not bodies. There are other things that are
called incorporeal by a wrong use of the word, not
because they are not bodies, but because they cannot
beget bodies. Thus the incorporeal first mentioned
above subsists within the body, while the incorporeal of
the second kind is completely separated from the body,
and from the incorporeal that subsists within the body.
The body, indeed, occupies a place, and the surface
does not exist outside of the body. But intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1240" id="Page_1240">1240</a></span>
and intellectual reason (discursive reason), do not
occupy any place, do not subsist in the body, do not
constitute any body, and do not depend on the body,
nor on any of the things that are called incorporeal by
abstraction of the body. On the other hand, if we
conceive of the void as incorporeal, intelligence cannot
exist within the void. The void, indeed, may receive
a body, but it cannot contain the actualization of intelligence,
nor serve as location for that actualization.
Of the two kinds of the incorporeal of which we have
just spoken, the followers of Zeno reject the one (the
incorporeal that exists outside of the body) and insist
on the other (the incorporeal that is separated from
the body by abstraction, and which has no existence
outside of the body); not seeing that the first kind of
incorporeality is not similar to the second, they refuse
all reality to the former, though they ought, nevertheless,
to acknowledge that the incorporeal (which subsists
outside of the body), is of another kind (than the
incorporeal that does not subsist outside of the body),
and not to believe that, because one kind of incorporeality
has no reality, neither can the other have any.</p>

<h3>RELATION BETWEEN THE INCORPOREAL AND THE
CORPOREAL.</h3>

<p>34. (2, 3, 4) Everything, if it be somewhere, is
there in some manner that conforms to its nature. For
a body that is composed of matter, and possesses
volume, to be somewhere, means that it is located in
some place. On the contrary, the intelligible world,
and in general the existence that is immaterial, and
incorporeal in itself, does not occupy any place, so that
the ubiquity of the incorporeal is not a local presence.
"It does not have one part here, and another there;"
for, if so, it would not be outside of all place, nor be
without extension; "wherever it is, it is entire; it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1241" id="Page_1241">1241</a></span>
present here and absent there;" for in this way it would
be contained in some one place, and excluded from
some other. "Nor is it nearer one place, and further
from some other," for only things that occupy place
stand in relations of distance. Consequently, the
sense-world is present to the intelligible in space; but
the intelligible is present to the sense-world in space;
but the intelligible is present to the sense-world without
having any parts, nor being in space. When the indivisible
is present in the divisible, "it is entire in each
part," identically and numerically one. "If simple and
indivisible existence become extended and manifold, it
is not in respect to the extended and manifold existence
which possesses it, not such as it really is, but in the
manner in which (simple existence) can possess (manifold
existence)." Extended and manifold existence
has to become unextended and simple in its relation
with naturally extended and simple existence, to enjoy
its presence. In other terms, it is conformable to its
nature, without dividing, nor multiplying, nor occupying
space, that intelligible existence is present to existence
that is naturally divisible, manifold, and contained
within a locality; but it is in a manifold, divisible
and local manner that a located existence is present to
"the existence that has no relation to space." In our
speculations on corporeal and incorporeal existence,
therefore, we must not confuse their characteristics,
preserving the respective nature of each, taking good
care not to let our imagination or opinion attribute to
the incorporeal certain corporeal qualities. Nobody
attributes to bodies incorporeal characteristics, because
everybody lives in daily touch with bodies; but as it is
so difficult to cognize incorporeal natures ("beings"),
only vague conceptions are formed of it, and they cannot
be grasped so long as one lets oneself be guided by
imagination. One has to say to oneself, a being known
by the senses is located in space, and is outside of itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1242" id="Page_1242">1242</a></span>
because it has a volume; "the intelligible being is not
located in space, but in itself," because it has no volume.
The one is a copy, the other is an archetype;
the one derives its existence from the intelligible, the
other finds it in itself; for every image is an image of
intelligence. The properties of the corporeal and the
incorporeal must be clearly kept in mind so as to avoid
surprise at their difference, in spite of their union, if
indeed it be permissible to apply the term "union" to
their mutual relation; for we must not think of the
union of corporeal substances, but of the union of substances
whose properties are completely incompatible,
according to the individuality of their hypostatic form
of existence. Such union differs entirely from that of
"homoousian" substances of the same nature; consequently,
it is neither a blend, nor a mixture, nor a real
union, nor a mere collocation. The relation between
the corporeal and the incorporeal is established in a
different manner, which manifests in the communication
of "homoousian" substances of the sense nature,
of which, however, no corporeal operation can give
any idea. The incorporeal being is wholly without
extension in all the parts of the extended being, even
though the number of these parts were infinite. "It is
present in an indivisible manner, without establishing
a correspondence between each of its parts with
the parts of the extended being;" it does not become
manifold merely because, in a manifold manner, it is
present to a multitude of parts. The whole of it is
entire in all the parts of the extended being, in each of
them, and in the whole mass, without dividing or becoming
manifold to enter into relations with the manifold,
preserving its numerical <span class="locked">identity.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></span> It is only to
beings whose power is dispersed that it belongs to possess
the intelligible by parts and by fractions. Often
these beings, on changing from their nature, imitate
intelligible beings by a deceptive appearance, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1243" id="Page_1243">1243</a></span>
are in doubt about their nature ("being"), for they
seem to have exchanged it for that of incorporeal
"being," or essence.</p>

<h3>THE INCORPOREAL HAS NO EXTENSION.</h3>

<p>37. (5) That which really exists has neither great
nor small. Greatness and smallness are attributes of
corporeal mass. By its identity and numerical unity,
real existence is neither great nor small, neither very
large nor very small, though it cause even greatest and
smallest to participate in its nature. It must not,
therefore, be represented as great, for in that case we
could not conceive how it could be located in the
smallest space without being diminished or condensed.
Nor should it be represented as small, which conception
of it would hinder our understanding how it could be
present in a whole large body without being increased
or extended. We must try to gain a simultaneous conception
of both that which is very large and very
small, and realize real existence as preserving its identity
and its indwelling in itself in any chance body
whatever, along with an infinity of other bodies of
different sizes. It is united to the extension of the
world, without extending itself, or uniting, and it exceeds
the extension of the world as well as that of its
parts, by embracing them within its unity. Likewise,
the world unites with real existence by all its parts, so
far as its nature allows it to do so, though it cannot,
however, embrace it entirely, nor contain its whole
power. Real existence is infinite and incomprehensible
for the world because, among other attributes, it possesses
that of having no extension.</p>

<p>38. <span class="locked">Great<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></span> magnitude is a hindrance for a body,
if, instead of comparing it to things of the same kind,
it is considered in relation with things of a different
nature; for volume is, as it were, a kind of procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1244" id="Page_1244">1244</a></span>
of existence outside of itself, and a breaking up of its
power. That which possesses a superior power is alien
to all extension; for potentiality does not succeed in
realizing its fulness until it concentrates within itself;
it needs to fortify itself to acquire all its energy. Consequently
the body, by extending into space, loses its
energy, and withdraws from the potency that belongs
to real and incorporeal existence; but real existence
does not weaken in extension, because, having no extension,
it preserves the greatness of its potency. Just
as, in relation to the body, real existence has neither
extension nor volume, likewise corporeal existence, in
relation to real existence, is weak and impotent. The
existence that possesses the greatest power does not
occupy any extension. Consequently, though the
world fill space, though it be everywhere united to real
extension, it could not, nevertheless, embrace the
greatness of its potency. It is united to real existence,
not by parts, but in an indivisible and indefinite manner.
Therefore, the incorporeal is present to the body,
not in a local manner, but by assimilation, so far as the
body is capable of being assimilated to the incorporeal,
and as the incorporeal can manifest in it. The incorporeal
is not present to the material, in so far as the
material is incapable of being assimilated to a completely
immaterial principle; however, the incorporeal
is present to the corporeal in so far as the corporeal
can be assimilated thereto. Nor is the incorporeal
present to the material by receptivity (in the sense that
one of these two substances would receive something
from the other); otherwise the material and the immaterial
would be altered; the former, on receiving the
immaterial, into which it would be transformed, and
the latter, on becoming material. Therefore, when a
relation is established between two substances that are
as different as the corporeal and the incorporeal, an
assimilation and participation that is reciprocal to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1245" id="Page_1245">1245</a></span>
power of the one, and the impotence of the other,
occurs. That is why the world always remains very
distant from the power of real existence, and the latter
from the impotence of material nature. But that
which occupies the middle, that which simultaneously
assimilates and is assimilated, that which unites the
extremes, becomes a cause of error in respect to them,
because the substances it brings together by assimilation
are very different.</p>

<h3>RELATION OF INDIVIDUAL SOULS TO THE
UNIVERSAL SOUL.</h3>

<p>39. <span class="locked">"It<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></span> would be wrong to suppose that the
manifoldness of souls was derived from the manifoldness
of bodies. The individual souls, as well as the
universal Soul, subsist independently of the bodies,
without the unity of the universal Soul absorbing the
manifoldness of individual souls, and without the
manifoldness of the latter splitting up the unity of the
universal Soul." Individual souls are distinct without
being separated from each other, and without dividing
the universal Soul into a number of parts; they are
united to each other without becoming confused, and
without making the universal Soul a mere total; "for
they are not separated by limits," and they are not
confused with each other; "they are as distinct from
each other as different sciences in a single soul."
Further, individual souls are not contained in the universal
Soul as if they were bodies, that is, like really
different substances (?), for they are qualitative actualizations
of the soul. Indeed, "the power of the
universal Soul is infinite," and all that participates in
her is soul; all the souls form the universal Soul, and,
nevertheless, the universal Soul exists independently of
all individual souls. Just as one does not arrive at the
incorporeal by infinite division of bodies, seeing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1246" id="Page_1246">1246</a></span>
such a division would modify them only in respect to
magnitude, likewise, on infinitely dividing the soul,
which is a living form, we reach nothing but species
(not individuals); for the Soul contains specific differences,
and she exists entire with them as well as
without them. Indeed, though the Soul should be
divided within herself, her diversity does not destroy
her identity. If the unity of bodies, in which manifoldness
prevails over identity, is not broken up by their
union with an incorporeal principle; if, on the contrary,
all of them possess the unity of "being" or substance,
and are divided only by qualities and other
forms; what shall we say or think of the species of
incorporeal life, where identity prevails over manifoldness,
and where there is no substrate alien to form,
and from which bodies might derive their unity? The
unity of the Soul could not be split up by her union
with a body, though the body often hinder her operations.
Being identical, the Soul discovers everything
by herself, because her actualizations are species, however
far the division be carried. When the Soul is
separated from bodies, each of her parts possesses all
the powers possessed by the Soul herself, just as an
individual seed has the same properties as the universal
Seed (seminal reason). As an individual seed, being
united to matter, preserves the properties of the universal
Seed (seminal reason), and as, on the other
hand, universal Seed possesses all the properties of the
individual seeds dispersed within matter, thus the parts
which we conceive of in the (universal) Soul that is
separated from matter, possess all the powers of the
universal <span class="locked">Soul.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></span> The individual soul, which declines
towards matter, is bound to the matter by the form
which her disposition has made her choose; but she
preserves the powers of the universal Soul, and she
unites with her when the (individual soul) turns away
from the body, to concentrate within herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1247" id="Page_1247">1247</a></span>
Now as in the course of her declination towards
matter, the soul is stripped entirely bare by the total
exhaustion of her own faculties; and as, on the contrary,
on rising towards intelligence, she recovers the
fulness of the powers of the universal <span class="locked">Soul,<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span> the
ancient philosophers were right, in their mystic phrasing,

Soul by the names of Penia and Poros, (Wealth and

the total unity is not all things in so far as it is
one, and as all things constitute the total unity). The
ancient philosophers also add, "in so far as it is one."
This was to prevent people from imagining a collective
whole and to indicate that the real being is all, only
by virtue of its indivisible unity. After having said,
"it is everywhere," they add, "it is nowhere." Then,
after having said, "it is in all," that is, in all individual
things whose disposition enables them to receive it,
they still add, as an entire whole. They represent it
thus simultaneously under the most opposite attributes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1248" id="Page_1248">1248</a></span>
so as to eliminate all the false imaginations which are
drawn from the natures of the bodies, and which will
only obscure the genuine idea of real existence.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INTELLIGIBLE BEING,
AND THE BEING OF SENSATION.</h3>

<p>41. <span class="locked">Such<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></span> are the genuine characteristics of the
sensual and material; it is extended, mutable, always
different from what it was, and composite; it does not
subsist by itself, it is located in a place, and has volume,
and so forth. On the contrary, the real being that is
self-subsisting, is founded on itself, and is always identical;
its nature ("being") is identity, it is essentially
immutable, simple, indissoluble, without extension, and
outside of all place; it is neither born, nor does it
perish. So let us define these characteristics of the
sensual and veritable existence, and let us put aside
all other attributes.</p>

<p>42. <span class="locked">Real<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></span> existence is said to be manifold,
without its really being different in space, volume,
number, figure, or extension of parts; its division is a
diversity without matter, volume, or real manifoldness.
Consequently, the real being is one. Its unity does not
resemble that of a body, of a place, of a volume, of a
multitude. It possesses diversity in unity. Its diversity
implies both division and union; for it is neither exterior
nor incidental; real existence is not manifold by
participation in some other (nature), but by itself. It
remains one by exercising all its powers, because it
holds its diversity from its very identity, and not by an
assemblage of heterogeneous parts, such as bodies.
The latter possess unity in diversity; for, in them, it is
diversity that dominates, the unity being exterior and
incidental. In real existence, on the contrary, it is
unity that dominates with identity; diversity is born of
the development of the power of unity. Consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1249" id="Page_1249">1249</a></span>
real existence preserves its indivisibility by multiplying
itself; while the body preserves its volume and multiplicity
by unifying itself. Real existence is founded on
itself, because it is one by itself. The body is never
founded upon itself, because it subsists only by its
extension. Real existence is, therefore, a fruitful unity,
and the body is a unified multitude. We must, therefore,
exactly determine how real existence is both one
and manifold, how the body is both manifold and one,
and we must guard from confusing the attributes of
either.</p>

<h3>THE DIVINITY IS EVERYWHERE AND NOWHERE.</h3>

<p>43. The <span class="locked">divinity<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></span> is everywhere because it is
nowhere. So also with intelligence and the soul. But
it is in relation to all beings that it surpasses, that the
divinity is everywhere and nowhere; its presence and
its absence depend entirely on its nature and its <span class="locked">will.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></span>
Intelligence is in the divinity, but it is only in relation
to the things that are subordinated to it, that intelligence
is everywhere and nowhere (?). The body is
within the soul and in divinity. All things that
possess or do not possess existence proceed from
divinity, and are within divinity; but the divinity
is none of them, nor in any of them. If the divinity
were only present everywhere, it would be all things,
and in all things; but, on the other hand, it is
nowhere; everything, therefore, is begotten in it
and by it, because it is everywhere, but nothing becomes
confused with it, because it is nowhere. Likewise
if intelligence be the principle of the souls and
of the things that come after the souls, it is because it
is everywhere and nowhere; because it is neither soul,
nor any of the things that come after the soul, nor in
any of them; it is because it is not only everywhere, but
also nowhere in respect to the beings that are inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1250" id="Page_1250">1250</a></span>
to it. Similarly the soul is neither a body, nor in the
body, but is only the cause of the body, because she is
simultaneously everywhere and nowhere in the body.
So there is procession in the universe (from what is
everywhere and nowhere), down to what can neither
simultaneously be everywhere and nowhere, and
which limits itself to participating in this double
property.</p>

<h3>THE HUMAN SOUL IS UNITED TO UNIVERSAL BEING
BY ITS NATURE.</h3>

<p>44. <span class="locked">"When<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></span> you have conceived of the inexhaustible
and infinite power of existence in itself, and
when you begin to realize its incessant and indefatigable
nature, which completely suffices itself," which
has the privilege of being the purest life, of possessing
itself fully, of being founded upon itself, of neither
desiring nor seeking anything outside of itself, "you
should not attribute to it any special determination,"
or any relation; for when you limit yourself by some
consideration of space or relation, you doubtlessly do
not limit existence in itself, but you turn away from it,
extending the veil of imagination over your thought.
"You can neither transgress, nor fix, nor determine,
nor condense within narrow limits, the nature of existence
in itself, as if it had nothing further to give beyond
(certain limits), exhausting itself gradually." It is the
most inexhaustible spring of which you can form a
notion. "When you will have achieved (?) that nature,
and when you will have become assimilated to
eternal existence, seek nothing beyond." Otherwise,
you will be going away from it, you will be directing
your glances on something else. "If you do not seek
anything beyond," if you shrink within yourself and
into your own nature, "you will become assimilated to
universal Existence, and you will not halt at anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1251" id="Page_1251">1251</a></span>
inferior to it. Do not say, That is what I am. Forgetting
what you are (?), you will become universal
Existence. You were already universal Existence, but
you had something besides; by that mere fact you were
inferior, because that possession of yours that was
beyond universal Existence was derived from nonentity.
Nothing can be added to universal Existence."
When we add to it something derived from nonentity,
we fall into poverty and into complete deprivation.
"Therefore, abandon nonentity, and you will fully
possess yourself, (in that you will acquire universal
existence by putting all else aside; for, so long as one
remains with the remainder, existence does not manifest;
and does not grant its presence)." Existence is
discovered by putting aside everything that degrades
and diminishes it, ceasing to confuse it with inferior
objects, and ceasing to form a false idea of it. Otherwise
one departs both from existence and from oneself.
Indeed, when one is present to oneself, he possesses
the existence that is present everywhere; when one
departs from himself, he also departs from it. So important
is it for the soul to acquaint herself with what
is in her, and to withdraw from what is outside of her;
for existence is within us, and nonentity is outside of
us. Now existence is present within us, when we are
not distracted from it by other things. "It does not
come near us to make us enjoy its presence. It is we
who withdraw from it, when it is not present with us."
Is there anything surprising in this? To be near existence,
you do not need to withdraw from yourselves; for
"you are both far from existence and near it, in this
sense that it is you who come near to it, and you who
withdraw from it, when, instead of considering yourselves,
you consider that which is foreign to you." If
then you are near existence while being far from it; if,
by the mere fact of your being ignorant of yourselves,
you know all things to which you are present, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1252" id="Page_1252">1252</a></span>
which are distant from you, rather than yourself who
is naturally near you, is there anything surprising in
that, that which is not near you should remain foreign
to you, since you withdraw from it when you withdraw
from yourself? Though you should always be
near yourself, and though you cannot withdraw from
it, you must be present with yourself to enjoy the
presence of the being from which you are so substantially
inseparable as from yourself. In that way it is
given you to know what exists near existence, and
what is distant from it, though itself be present everywhere
and nowhere. He who by thought can penetrate
within his own substance, and can thus acquire
knowledge of it, finds himself in this actualization of
knowledge and consciousness, where the substrate that
knows is identical with the object that is known. Now
when a man thus possesses himself, he also possesses
existence. He who goes out of himself to attach himself
to external objects, withdraws also from existence,
when withdrawing also from himself. It is natural to
us to establish ourselves within ourselves, where we
enjoy the whole wealth of our own resources, and not
to turn ourselves away from ourselves towards what is
foreign to ourselves, and where we find nothing but
the most complete poverty. Otherwise, we are withdrawing
from existence, though it be near us; for it is
neither space, nor "being" (substance), nor any obstacle
that separates us from existence; it is our reversion
towards nonentity. Our alienation from ourselves,
and our ignorance are thus a just punishment of our
withdrawal from existence. On the contrary, the love
that the soul has for herself leads her to self-knowledge
and communion with the divinity. Consequently, it
has rightly been said that man here below is in a
prison, because he has fled from <span class="locked">heaven<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></span> ... and
because he tries to break his bonds; for, when he
turns towards things here below, he has abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1253" id="Page_1253">1253</a></span>
himself, and has withdrawn from his divine origin. It
is, (as Empedocles says), "a fugitive who has deserted
his heavenly <span class="locked">fatherland."<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></span> That is why the life of a
vicious man is a life that is servile, impious, and unjust,
and his spirit is full of impiety and <span class="locked">injustice.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></span>
On the contrary, justice, as has been rightly said, consists
in each one fulfilling his function (?). To distribute
to each person his due is genuine justice.</p>

<h3 class="larger bold">A. On the Faculties of the Soul, by <span class="locked">Porphyry.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></span></h3>

<h3>OBJECT OF THE BOOK.</h3>

<p>We propose to describe the faculties of the soul, and
to set forth the various opinions on the subject held by
both ancient and modern thinkers.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SENSATION AND
INTELLIGENCE.</h3>

<p>Aristo (there were two philosophers by this name,
one a Stoic, the other an Aristotelian) attributes to the
soul a perceptive faculty, which he divides into two
parts. According to him, the first, called sensibility,
the principle and origin of sensations, is usually kept
active by some one of the sense-organs. The other,
which subsists by itself, and without organs, does not
bear any special name in beings devoid of reason, in
whom reason does not manifest, or at least manifests
only in a feeble or obscure manner; however, it is
called intelligence in beings endowed with reason,
among whom alone it manifests clearly. Aristo holds
that sensibility acts only with the help of the sense-organs,
and that intelligence does not need them to
enter into activity. Why then does he subordinate
both of these to a single genus, called the perceptive
faculty? Both doubtless perceive, but the one perceives
the sense-form of beings, while the other perceives
their essence. Indeed, sensibility does not perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1255" id="Page_1255">1255</a></span>
the essence, but the sense-form, and the figure; it
is intelligence that perceives whether the object be a
man or a horse. There are, therefore, two kinds of perception
that are very different from each other; sense-perception
receives an impression, and applies itself
to an exterior object; on the contrary, intellectual
perception does not receive any impression.</p>

<p>There have been philosophers who separated these
two parts; they called intelligence or discursive reason
the understanding which is exercised without imagination
and sensation; and opinion, the understanding
which is exercised with imagination and sensation.
Others, on the contrary, considered rational "being,"
or nature, a simple essence, and attributed to it operations
whose nature is entirely different. Now it is
unreasonable to refer to the same essence faculties
which differ completely in nature; for thought and
sensation could not depend on the same essential principle;
and if we were to call the operation of intelligence
a perception, we would only be juggling with
words. We must, therefore, establish a perfectly
clear distinction between these two entities, intelligence
and sensibility. On the one hand, intelligence possesses
a quite peculiar nature, as is also the case with
discursive reason, which is next below it. The function
of the former is intuitive thought, while that of the
latter is discursive thought. On the other hand, sensibility
differs entirely from intelligence, acting with or
without the help of organs; in the former case, it is
called sensation; in the latter, imagination. Nevertheless,
sensation and imagination belong to the same
genus. In understanding, intuitive intelligence is
superior to opinion, which applies to sensation or
imagination; this latter kind of thought, whether
called discursive thought, or anything else (such as
opinion), is superior to sensation and imagination, but
inferior to intuitive thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1256" id="Page_1256">1256</a></span></p>

<h3>OF ASSENT.</h3>

<p>Numenius, who teaches that the faculty of assent
(or, combining faculty) is capable of producing various
operations, says that representation (fancy) is an accessory
of this faculty, that it does not, however, constitute
either an operation or function of it, but a
consequence of it. The Stoics, on the contrary, not
only make sensation consist in representation, but even
reduce representation to (combining) assent. According
to them sense-imagination (or sense-fancy) is
assent, or the sensation of the determination of assent.
Longinus, however, does not acknowledge any faculty
of assent. The philosophers of the ancient Academy
(the Platonists) believe that sensation does not comprise
sense-representation, and that, consequently, it
does not have any original property, since it does not
participate in assent. If sense representation consisted
of assent added to sensation, sensation, by itself, will
have no virtue, since it is not the assent given to the
things we possess.</p>

<h3>OF THE PARTS OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>It is not only about the faculties that the ancient
philosophers disagree.... They are besides in radical
disagreement about the following questions: What
are the parts of the soul; what is a part; what is a
faculty; what difference is there between a part and a
faculty?</p>

<p>The Stoics divide the soul into eight parts: the five
senses, speech, sex-power, and the directing (predominating)
principle, which is served by the other
faculties, so that the soul is composed of a faculty
that commands, and faculties that obey.</p>

<p>In their writing about ethics, Plato and Aristotle
divide the soul into three parts. This division has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1257" id="Page_1257">1257</a></span>
been adopted by the greater part of later philosophers;
but these have not understood that the object of this
definition was to classify and define the virtues (Plato:
reason, anger and appetite; Aristotle: locomotion, appetite
and understanding). Indeed, if this classification
be carefully scrutinized, it will be seen that it fails
to account for all the faculties of the soul; it neglects
imagination, sensibility, intelligence, and the natural
faculties (the generative and nutritive powers).</p>

<p>Other philosophers, such as Numenius, do not teach
one soul in three parts, like the preceding, nor in two,
such as the rational and irrational parts. They believe
that we have two souls, one rational, the other irrational.
Some among them attribute immortality to
both of the souls; others attribute it only to the rational
soul, and think that death not only suspends the exercise
of the faculties that belong to the irrational soul,
but even dissolves its "being" or essence. Last, there
are some that believe, that by virtue of the union of
the two souls, their movements are double, because
each of them feels the passions of the other.</p>

<h3>OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE PARTS, AND OF THE
FACULTIES OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>We shall now explain the difference obtaining between
a part and a faculty of the soul. One part
differs from another by the characteristics of its genus
(or, kind); while different faculties may relate to a
common genus. That is why Aristotle did not allow
that the soul contained parts, though granting that it
contained faculties. Indeed, the introduction of a new
part changes the nature of the subject, while the diversity
of faculties does not alter its unity. Longinus did
not allow in the animal (or, living being) for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1258" id="Page_1258">1258</a></span>
parts, but only for several faculties. In this respect,
he followed the doctrine of Plato, according to whom
the soul, in herself indivisible, is divided within bodies.
Besides, that the soul does not have several parts does
not necessarily imply that she has only a single faculty;
for that which has no parts may still possess several
faculties.</p>

<p>To conclude this confused discussion, we shall have
to lay down a principle of definition which will help
to determine the essential differences and resemblances
that exist either between the parts of a same subject, or
between its faculties, or between its parts and its faculties.
This will clearly reveal whether in the organism
the soul really has several parts, or merely several
faculties, and what opinion about them should be
adopted. (For there are two special types of these.)
The one attributes to man a single soul, genuinely
composed of several parts, either by itself, or in relation
to the body. The other one sees in man a union
of several souls, looking on the man as on a choir,
the harmony of whose parts constitutes its unity, so
that we find several essentially different parts contributing
to the formation of a single being.</p>

<p>First we shall have to study within the soul the
differentials between the part, the faculty and the disposition.
A part always differs from another by the
substrate, genus, and function. A disposition in a
special aptitude of some one part to carry out the part
assigned to it by nature. A faculty is the habit of a
disposition, the power inherent in some part to do the
thing for which it has a disposition. There was no
great inconvenience in confusing faculty and disposition;
but there is an essential difference between part
and faculty. Whatever the number of faculties, they
can exist within a single "being," or nature, without
occupying any particular point in the extension of the
substrate, while the parts somewhat participate in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1259" id="Page_1259">1259</a></span>
extension, occupying therein a particular point. Thus
all the properties of an apple are gathered within a
single substrate, but the different parts that compose it
are separate from each other. The notion of a part
implies the idea of quantity in respect to the totality of
the subject. On the contrary, the notion of a faculty
implies the idea of totality. That is why the faculties
remain indivisible, because they penetrate the whole
substrate, while the parts are separate from each other
because they have a quantity.</p>

<p>How then may we say that a soul is indivisible,
while having three parts? For when we hear it
asserted that she contains three parts in respect to
quantity, it is reasonable to ask how the soul can simultaneously
be indivisible, and yet have three parts.
This difficulty may be solved as follows: the soul is
indivisible in so far as she is considered within her
"being," and in herself; and that she has three parts
in so far as she is united to a divisible body, and that
she exercises her different faculties in the different
parts of the body. Indeed, it is not the same faculty
that resides in the head, in the breast, or in the <span class="locked">liver;<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></span>
(the seats of reason, of anger and appetite). Therefore,
when the soul has been divided into several parts,
it is in this sense that her different functions are exercised
within different parts of the body.</p>

<p>Nicholas (of <span class="locked">Damascus<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></span>), in his book "On the
Soul," used to say that the division of the soul was
not founded on quantity, but on quality, like the
division of an art or a science. Indeed, when we consider
an extension, we see that the whole is a sum of
its parts, and that it increases or diminishes according
as a part is added or subtracted. Now it is not in this
sense that we attribute parts to the soul; she is not
the sum of her parts, because she is neither an extension
nor a multitude. The parts of the soul resemble
those of an art. There is, however, this difference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1260" id="Page_1260">1260</a></span>
that an art is incomplete or imperfect if it lack some
part, while every soul is perfect, and while every
organism that has not achieved the goal of its nature
is an imperfect being.</p>

<p>Thus by parts of the soul Nicholas means the different
faculties of the organism. Indeed, the organism,
and, in general, the animated being, by the mere fact
of possessing a soul, possesses several faculties, such as
life, feeling, movement, thought, desire, and the cause
and principle of all of them is the soul. Those, therefore,
who distinguish parts in the soul thereby mean
the faculties by which the animated being can produce
actualizations, or experience affections. While the
soul herself is said to be indivisible, nothing hinders
her functions from being divided. The organism,
therefore, is divisible, if we introduce within the notion
of the soul that of the body; for the vital functions by
the soul communicated to the body must thereby
necessarily be divided by the diversity of the organs,
and it is this division of vital functions that has caused
parts to be ascribed to the soul herself. As the soul
can be conceived of in two different conditions, according
as she lives within herself, or as she declines
towards the <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></span> it is only when she declines towards
the body that she splits up into parts. When a seed of
corn is sowed, and produces an ear, we see in this ear
of corn the appearance of parts, though the whole it
forms be <span class="locked">indivisible,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></span> and these indivisible parts themselves
later return to an indivisible unity; likewise,
when the soul, which by herself is indivisible, finds
herself united to the body, parts are seen to appear.</p>

<p>We must still examine which are the faculties that
the soul develops by herself (intelligence and discursive
reason), and which the soul develops by the
animal (sensation). This will be the true means of
illustrating the difference between these two natures
("beings"), and the necessity of reducing to the soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1261" id="Page_1261">1261</a></span>
herself those parts of her "being" which have been
enclosed within the parts of the <span class="locked">body.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></span></p>

<h3 class="larger bold">B. <span class="locked">Jamblichus.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></span></h3>

<p>Plato, Archytas, and the other Pythagoreans divide
the soul into three parts, reason, anger, and appetite,
which they consider to be necessary to form the
ground-work for the virtues. They assign to the soul
as faculties the natural (generative) power, sensibility,
imagination, locomotion, love of the good and beautiful,
and last, intelligence.</p>

<h3 class="larger bold">C. <span class="locked">Nemesius.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></span></h3>

<p>Aristotle says, in his <span class="locked">Physics,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></span> that the soul has five
faculties, the power of growth, sensation, locomotion,
appetite, and understanding. But, in his Ethics, he
divides the soul into two principal parts, which are
rational part, and the irrational part; then Aristotle
subdivides the latter into the part that is subject to
reason, and the part not subject to reason.</p>

<h3 class="larger bold">D. <span class="locked">Jamblichus.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></span></h3>

<p>The Platonists hold different opinions. Some, like
Plotinos and Porphyry, reduce to a single order and
idea the different functions and faculties of life; others,
like Numenius, imagine them to be opposed, as if in a
struggle; while others, like Atticus and Plutarch, bring
harmony out of the struggle.</p>

<h3 class="larger bold">E. Ammonius Saccas.</h3>

<h3 class="large">A. FROM <span class="locked">NEMESIUS.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></span></h3>

<h3>ON THE IMMATERIALITY OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>It will suffice to oppose the arguments of Ammonius,
teacher of Plotinos, and those of Numenius the Pythagorean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1262" id="Page_1262">1262</a></span>
to that of all those who claim that the soul is
material. These are the reasons: "Bodies, containing
nothing unchangeable, are naturally subject to change,
to dissolution, and to infinite divisions. They inevitably
need some principle that may contain them, that may
bind and strengthen their parts; this is the unifying
principle that we call soul. But if the soul also be
material, however subtle be the matter of which she
may be composed, what could contain the soul herself,
since we have just seen that all matter needs some
principle to contain it? The same process will go on
continuously to infinity until we arrive at an immaterial
substance."</p>

<h3>UNION OF THE SOUL AND THE BODY.</h3>

<p>Ammonius, teacher of Plotinos, thus explained the
present problem (the union of soul and body): "The
intelligible is of a nature such that it unites with whatever
is able to receive it, as intimately as the union of
things, that mutually alter each other in uniting,
though, at the same time, it remains pure and incorruptible,
as do things that merely <span class="locked">coexist.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></span> Indeed,
in the case of bodies, union alters the parts that meet,
since they form new bodies; that is how elements
change into composite bodies, food into blood, blood
into flesh, and other parts of the body. But, as to the
intelligible, the union occurs without any alteration;
for it is repugnant to the nature of the intelligible to
undergo an alteration in its essential nature. It disappears,
or it ceases to be, but it is not susceptible of
change. Now the intelligible cannot be annihilated;
otherwise it would not be immortal; and as the soul
is life, if it changed in its union with the body, it would
become something different, and would no longer be
life. What would the soul afford to the body, if not
life? In her union (with the body, therefore), the
soul undergoes no alteration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1263" id="Page_1263">1263</a></span>
Since it has been demonstrated that, in its essential
nature, the intelligible is immutable, the necessary result
must be that it does not alter at the same time as
the entities to which it is united. The soul, therefore,
is united to the body, but she does not form a mixture
with <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></span> The sympathy that exists between them
shows that they are united; for the entirely animated
being is a whole that is sympathetic to itself, and that
is consequently really <span class="locked">one.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></span></p>

<p>What proves that the soul does not form a mixture
with the body, is the soul's power to separate from the
body during sleep; leaving the body as it were inanimate,
with only a breath of life, to keep it from dying
entirely; using her own activity only in dreams, to foresee
the future, and to live in the intelligible world.</p>

<p>This appears again when the soul gathers herself
together to devote herself to her thoughts; for then she
separates from the body so far as she can, and retires
within herself better to be able to apply herself to the
consideration of intelligible things. Indeed, being incorporeal,
she unites with the body as closely as the
union of things which by combining together perish
because of each other, (thus giving birth to a mixture);
at the same time, she remains without alteration, as
two things that are only placed by each others' side;
and she preserves her unity. Thus, according to her
own life, she modifies that to which she is united, but
she is not modified thereby. Just as the sun, by its
presence, makes the air luminous, without itself changing
in any way, and thus, so to speak, mingles itself
therewith, without mingling itself (in reality), so the
soul, though united with the body, remains quite distinct
therefrom. But there is this difference, that the
sun, being a body, and consequently being circumscribed
within a certain space, is not everywhere
where is its light; just as the fire dwells in the wood,
or in the wick of the lamp, as if enclosed within a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1264" id="Page_1264">1264</a></span>
locality; but the soul, being incorporeal, and not being
subjected to any local limitation, exists as a whole
everywhere where her light is; and there is no part of
the body that is illuminated by the soul in which the
soul is not entirely present. It is not the body that
commands the soul; it is the soul, on the contrary, that
commands the body. She is not in the body as if in a
vase or a gourd; it is rather the body that is in the
<span class="locked">soul.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></span></p>

<p>The intelligible, therefore, is not imprisoned within
the body; it spreads in all the body's parts, it penetrates
them, it goes through them, and could not be enclosed
in any place; for by virtue of its nature, it resides in the
intelligible world; it has no locality other than itself,
or than an intelligible situated still higher. Thus the
soul is within herself when she reasons, and in intelligence
when she yields herself to contemplation. When
it is asserted that the soul is in the body, it is not meant
that the soul is in it as in a locality; it is only meant
that the soul is in a habitual relation with the body;
and that the soul is present there, as we say that God
is in us. For we think that the soul is united to the
body, not in a corporeal and local manner, but by the
soul's habitual relations, her inclination and disposition,
as a lover is attached to his beloved. Besides, as the
affection of the soul has neither extension, nor weight,
nor parts, she could not be circumscribed by local
limitations. Within what place could that which has
no parts be contained? For place and corporeal extension
are inseparable; the place is limited space in
which the container contains the contained. But if we
were to say, "My soul is then in Alexandria, in Rome,
and everywhere else;" we would be still speaking of
space carelessly, since being in Alexandria, or in general,
being somewhere, is being in a place; now the
soul is absolutely in no place; she can only be in some
relation with some place, since it has been demonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1265" id="Page_1265">1265</a></span>
that she could not be contained within a place.
If then an intelligible entity "be in relation with a
place, or with something located in a place, we say,
in a figurative manner, that this intelligible entity is in
this place, because it tends thither by its activity; and
we take the location for the inclination or for the
activity which leads it thither. If we were to say, That
is where the soul acts, we would be saying, "The soul
is there."</p>

<h3 class="larger">B. NOTICE OF AMMONIUS BY <span class="locked">HIEROCLES.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></span></h3>

<p>Then shone the wisdom of Ammonius, who is
famous under the name of "Inspired by the Divinity."
It was he, in fact, who, purifying the opinions of the
ancient philosophers, and dissipating the fancies woven
here and there, established harmony between the
teaching of Plato, and that of Aristotle, in that which
was most essential and fundamental.... It was Ammonius
of Alexandria, the "Inspired by the Divinity,"
who, devoting himself enthusiastically to the truth in
philosophy, and rising above the popular notions that
made of philosophy an object of scorn, clearly understood
the doctrine of Plato and of Aristotle, gathered
them into a single ideal, and thus peacefully handed
philosophy down to his disciples Plotinos, the (pagan)
Origen, and their successors.</p>

IN SOURCES, DEVELOPMENT AND INFLUENCE.</a></h2>

<h2><a name="I_DEVELOPMENT_IN_THE_TEACHINGS_OF" id="I_DEVELOPMENT_IN_THE_TEACHINGS_OF">I. DEVELOPMENT IN THE TEACHINGS OF
PLOTINOS.</a></h2>

<p>It was only through long hard work that the writer
arrived at conclusions which the reader may be disposed
to accept as very natural, under the circumstances. It
is possible that the reader may, nevertheless, be interested
in the manner in which the suggestion here
advanced was reached.</p>

<p>The writer had for several years been working at the
premier edition of the fragments of Numenius, in
reasonably complete form, with translation and outline.
After ransacking the accessible sources of fragments,
there remained yet an alleged treatise of
Numenius on Matter, in the library of the Escoreal,
near Madrid. This had been known to savants in Germany
for many years; and Prof. Uzener, of Bonn, in his
criticism of Thedinga's partial collection of fragments,
had expressed a strong desire that it be investigated;
it had also been noticed by Zeller, and Bouillet, as well
as Chaignet. If then I hoped to publish a comparatively
reliable collection of the fragments of Numenius, it was
my duty, though hailing from far America, and though
no European had shown enough interest therein to send
for a photographic copy, to go there, and get one,
which I did in July, 1913. I bore the precious fragment
to Rostock and Prof. Thedinga in Hagen, where,
however, we discovered that it was no more than a
section of Plotinos's Enneads, iii. 6.6 to end. The
manuscript did, indeed, show an erasure of the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1270" id="Page_1270">1270</a></span>
of Plotinos, and the substitution of that of Numenius.
After the first disappointment, it became unavoidable
to ask the question why the monk should have done
that. Had he any reason to suppose that this represented
Numenian doctrine, even if it was not written
by Numenius? Having no external data to go by, it
became necessary to resort to internal criticism, to compare
this Plotinian treatment of matter with other
Plotinian treatments, in other portions of the Enneads.</p>

<p>This then inevitably led to a close scrutiny of
Plotinos's various treatments of the subject, with results
that were very much unlooked for. This part
that we might well have had reason to ascribe to
Numenian influence, on the contrary, turned out to be
by far more Plotinian than other sections that we
would at first have unhesitatingly considered Plotinian,
and, as will be seen elsewhere, the really doubtful
portions occur in the very last works of Plotinos's life,
where it would have been more natural to expect the
most genuine. However, the result was a demonstration
of a progress in doctrines in the career of Plotinos,
and after a careful study thereof, the reader will agree
that we have in this case every element of probability
in favor of such a development; indeed, it will seem so
natural that the unbiased reader will ask himself why
this idea has not before this been the general view of
the matter.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>First a few words about the distinction of periods in
general. Among unreflecting people, for centuries, it
has been customary to settle disputes by appeals to the
Bible as a whole. This was always satisfactory, until
somebody else came along who held totally different
views, which he supported just as satisfactorily from
the same authority. The result was the century-long
bloody wars of the Reformation, everywhere leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1271" id="Page_1271">1271</a></span>
in that particular place, as the orthodox, the stronger.
Since thirty years, however, the situation has changed.
The contradictions of the Bible, so long the ammunition
of scoffers of the type of Ingersoll, became the
pathfinders of the Higher Criticism, which has solved
the otherwise insoluble difficulties by showing them
to rest on parallel documents, and different authors.
It is no longer sufficient to appeal to Isaiah; we must
now specify which Isaiah we mean; and we may no
longer refer to the book of Genesis, but to the Jehovistic
or Elohistic documents.</p>

<p>This method of criticism is slowly gaining ground
with other works. The writer, for instance, applied it
with success to the Gathas, or hymns of Zoroaster.
These appear in the Yasnas in two sections which
have ever given the editors much trouble. Either they
were printed in the meaningless traditional order, or
they were mixed confusedly according to the editor's
fancy, resulting of course in a fancy picture. The
writer, however, discovered they were duplicate lives
of Zoroaster, and printing them on opposite pages, he
has shown parallel development, reducing the age-long
difficulties to perfectly reasonable, and mutually confirming
order.</p>

<p>Another case is that of Plato. It is still considered
allowable to quote the authority of Plato, as such; but
in scientific matters we must always state which period
of Plato's activities, the Plato of the Republic, or the
more conservative Plato of the Laws, and the evil
World-soul, is meant.</p>

<p>Another philosopher in the same case is Schelling,
among whose views the text-books distinguish as many
as five different periods. This is no indication of
mental instability, but rather a proof that he remained
awake as long as he lived. No man can indeed continue
to think with genuineness without changing his
views; and only men as great as Bacon or Emerson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1272" id="Page_1272">1272</a></span>
have had the temerity to discredit consistency when it
is no more than mental inertia.</p>

<p>There are many other famous men who changed
their views. Prominent among them is Goethe, whose
Second Faust, finished in old age, strongly contrasted
with the First Part. What then would be inherently
unlikely in Plotinos's changing his views during the
course of half a century of philosophical activity? On
the contrary, it would be a much greater marvel had he
not done so; and the burden of proof really lies with
the partisans of unchanging opinions.</p>

<p>For example: in ii. 4 we find Plotinos discussing the
doctrine of two matters, the physical and the intelligible.
In the very next book, of the same Ennead, in
ii. 5.3, we find him discrediting this same intelligible
matter. Moreover, in i. 8.7, he approves of the world
as mixture; in ii. 4.7 he disapproves of it. What do
these contradictions mean? That Plotinos was unreliable?
That he was mentally incoherent? No,
something much simpler. By consulting the tables of
Porphyry, we discover of the first two, that the first
statement was made during the Amelian period, and
the latter during the Porphyrian. Another case of such
contradiction is his assertion of positive evil (i. 8) and
his denial thereof (ii. 9). The latter assertion is of the
Porphyrian period, the former is Eustochian; while of
the latter two, the first was Eustochian; and the second
Amelian. It is simply a case of development of doctrines
at different periods of his life.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Let us now examine Plotinos's various treatments
of the subject of matter.</p>

<p>The first treatment of matter occurs in the first
Ennead, and it may be described as thoroughly Numenian,
being treated in conjunction with the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1273" id="Page_1273">1273</a></span>
of evil. First, we have the expression of the Supreme
hovering over <span class="locked">Being.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></span> Then we have the soul <span class="locked">double,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></span>
reminding us of Numenius's view of the double Second
<span class="locked">Divinity<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></span> and the double <span class="locked">soul.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></span> Then we have positive
evil occurring in the absence of <span class="locked">good.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></span> <span class="locked">Plotinos<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></span> opposes
the Stoic denial of evil, for he says, "if this were
all," there were no evil. We find a threefold division
of the universe without the Stoic term hypostasis, which
occurs in the treatment of the same topic <span class="locked">elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></span>
Similar to Numenius is the King of <span class="locked">all,<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></span> the blissful
life of the divinities around <span class="locked">him,<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></span> and the division of
the universe into <span class="locked">three.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></span> <span class="locked">Plotinos<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></span> acknowledges
evil things in the world, something denied by the
<span class="locked">Stoics,<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></span> but taught by Numenius, as is also original,
primary existence of evil, in itself. Evil is here said
to be a hypostasis in itself, and imparts evil qualities
to other things. It is an image of being, and a genuine
nature of evil. Plotinos <span class="locked">describes<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></span> matter as flowing
eternally, which reminds us unmistakably of Numenius's
<span class="locked">image<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></span> of matter as a swiftly flowing stream,
unlimited and infinite in depth, breadth, and length.
Evil inheres in the material part of the <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></span> and is
seen as actual, positive, darkness, which is Numenian,
as far as it means a definite <span class="locked">principle.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></span> Plotinos <span class="locked">also<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a></span>
insists on the ineradicability of evil, in almost the same
terms as <span class="locked">Numenius,<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></span> who calls on Heraclitus and
Homer as supporters. <span class="locked">Plotinos<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></span> as reason for this
assigns the fact that the world is a mixture, which
is the very proof advanced by Numenius in 12. Plotinos,
<span class="locked">moreover,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></span> defines matter as that which remains
after all qualities are abstracted; this is thoroughly
<span class="locked">Numenian.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></span></p>

<p>In the fourth book of the Second Ennead the treatment
of matter is original, and is based on comparative
studies. Evil has disappeared from the horizon; and
the long treatment of the controversy with the <span class="locked">Gnostics<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></span>
is devoted to explaining away evil as misunderstood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1274" id="Page_1274">1274</a></span>
good. Although he begins by finding fault with
Stoic <span class="locked">materialism,<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></span> he asserts two matters, the intelligible
and the physical. Intelligible <span class="locked">matter<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></span> is eternal,
and possesses essence. Plotinos goes <span class="locked">on<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></span> to argue
for the necessity of an intelligible, as well as a physical
substrate (hypokeimenon). In the next <span class="locked">paragraph<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></span>
Plotinos seems to undertake a historical polemic,
against three traditional teachers (Empedocles, Anaxagoras,
and Democritus) under whose names he was
surely finding fault with their disciples: the Stoics,
Numenius, and possibly such thinkers as Lucretius.
Empedocles is held responsible for the view that elements
are material, evidently a Stoical view. Anaxagoras
is held responsible for three views, which are
distinctly Numenian: that the world is a <span class="locked">mixture,<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></span> that
it is all in <span class="locked">all,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></span> and that it is <span class="locked">infinite.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></span> We might, in
passing, notice another Plotinian contradiction in here
condemning the world as mixture, approved in the
former <span class="locked">passage.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></span> As to the atomism of Democritus,
it is not clear with which contemporaries he was finding
fault. Intelligible matter <span class="locked">reappears<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></span> where we
also find again the idea of doubleness of everything.
As to the terms used by the way, we find the Stoic
categories of Otherness or <span class="locked">Variety<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></span> and Motion; the
conceptual seminal logoi, and the "Koinê ousia" of
matter; but in his psychology he uses "logos" and
"noêsis," instead of "nous" and "phronesis," which
are found in the Escorial section, and which are more
Stoical. We also find the Aristotelian category of
energy, or potentiality.</p>

<p>In the very next book of the same <span class="locked">Ennead,<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></span> we find
another treatment of matter, on an entirely different
basis, accented by a rejection of intelligible <span class="locked">matter.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a></span>
Here the whole basis of the treatment of matter is the
Aristotelian category of "energeia" and "dunamis," or
potentiality and actuality, Although we find the Stoic
term hypostasis, the book seems to be more Numenian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1275" id="Page_1275">1275</a></span>
for matter is again a positive lie, and the divinity is
described by the Numenian double <span class="locked">name<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></span> of Being
and Essence ("ousia" and "to on").</p>

<p>We now come to the Escorial <span class="locked">section.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></span> This is by
far the most extensive treatment of matter, and as we
are chiefly interested in it in connection with its bearing
the name of Numenius at the Escorial, we shall
analyze it for and against this Numenian authorship,
merely noting that the chief purpose is to describe the
impassibility of matter, a Stoic idea.</p>

<p>For Numenius as author we note:</p>

<p>a. A great anxiety to preserve agreement with
Plato, even to the point of stretching <span class="locked">definitions.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></span></p>

<p>b. Plato's idea of participation, useless to monistic
Stoics, is repeatedly <span class="locked">used.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></span> Numenius had gone so
far as to assert a participation, even in the <span class="locked">intelligibles.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></span></p>

<p>c. Matter appears as the curse of all existent <span class="locked">objects.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></span>
It also appears as <span class="locked">mother.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></span></p>

<p>d. Try as he may, the author of this section cannot
escape the dualism so prominent in <span class="locked">Numenius;<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></span> the
acrobatic nature of his efforts in this direction are
pointed out elsewhere. We find here a thoroughgoing
distinction between soul and body, which is quite
Numenian, and <span class="locked">dualistic.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></span></p>

<p>e. Matter is passive, possessing no <span class="locked">resiliency.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></span></p>

<p>f. We find an argument <span class="locked">directed<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a></span> against those
who "posit being in matter." These must be the Stoics,
with whom Numenius is ever in feud.</p>

<p>g. Of Numenian terms, we find "sôteria,"<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> God
the <span class="locked">Father.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a></span> Also the double Numenian name for the
Divinity, Being and <span class="locked">Essence.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></span></p>

<p>Against Numenius as author, we note:</p>

<p>a. The general form of the section, which is that of
the Enneads, not the dialogue of Numenius's Treatise
on the Good. We find also the usual Plotinic interjected
questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1276" id="Page_1276">1276</a></span>
b. Un-Numenian, at least, is matter as a <span class="locked">mirror,<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></span>
and evil as merely negative, merely unaffectability to
<span class="locked">good.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></span> While Numenius speaks of matter as nurse
and feeder, here we read nurse and receptacle.</p>

<p>c. Stoic, is the chief subject of the section, namely
the affectibility of matter. Also, the allegoric interpretation
of the myths, of the ithyphallic Hermes, and
the Universal Mother, which are like the other Plotinic
myths, of the double Hercules, Poros, Penia, and
Koros. We <span class="locked">find<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></span> the Stoic idea of passibility and
impassibility, although not exactly that of passion and
action. We <span class="locked">find<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></span> connected the terms "nous" and
"phronêsis," also "anastasis." The term hypostasis,
though used undogmatically, as mere explanation of
thought, is <span class="locked">found.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></span> <span class="locked">Frequent<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></span> are the conceptual
logoi of the divine Mind (the seminal logoi) which
enter into matter to clothe themselves with it, to produce
objects. We also have the Stoic category

of the differences of the <span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></span></p>

<p>d. Aristotelian, are the "energeia" and <span class="locked">"dunamis."<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></span></p>

<p>e. Plotinic, are the latter ideas, for they are used in
the same <span class="locked">connection.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></span> Also the myths of Poros,
Penia and Koros, which are found elsewhere in similar
<span class="locked">relations.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, therefore, the Plotinic authorship is
much more strongly indicated than the Numenian.</p>

<p>The next treatment of matter in the Fourth Ennead,
is <span class="locked">semi-stoical.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></span> The opposite aspects of the Universe
appear again as "phronesis" and "phusis." We find
here the Stoic doing and suffering, <span class="locked">and<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></span> hypostasis.
Nevertheless, the chief process illustrated is still the
Platonic image reproduced less and less clearly in successively
more degraded spheres of being. Plotinos
seems to put himself out of the Numenian sphere of
thought, referring to it in abstract historical manner, as
belonging to the successors of Pythagoras and Pherecydes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1277" id="Page_1277">1277</a></span>
who treated of matter as the element that distinguished
objects in the intelligible world.</p>

<p>The last treatment of <span class="locked">matter<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></span> seems to have reached
the extreme distance of Numenianism. Instead of a
dualism, with matter an original, positive principle,
Plotinos closes his discussion by stating that perhaps
form and matter may not come from the same origin,
as there is some difference between them. He has just
said that Being is common to both form and matter,
as to quality, though not as to quantity. A little above
this he insists that matter is not something original,
as it is later than many earthly, and than all intelligible
objects. As to the Numenian double name of the
Divinity, Being and Essence, he had taken from Aristotelianism
the conceptions of "energeia" and "dunamis,"
and added them as the supreme hypostasis, so as
to form in theological dialect the triad he, following
Numenius and Plato, had always asserted cosmologically
(good, intellect, and soul): "The developed
<span class="locked">energy<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></span> assumes hypostasis, as if from a great, nay,
as from the greatest hypostasis of all; and so it joins
Essence and Being."</p>

<p>Reviewing these various treatments of matter we
might call the <span class="locked">first<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></span> Numenian; the <span class="locked">next<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></span> Platonic
(as most independent, and historically treated); the
<span class="locked">next<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></span> as Aristotelian; the Escorial Section as <span class="locked">semi-Stoic;<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></span>
as also another short <span class="locked">notice.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></span> The last treatment
of matter, in vi. 3.7, is fully Stoic, in its denial
of the evil of matter.</p>

<p>How then shall we explain these differences?
Chiefly by studying the periods in which they are
written, and which they therefore explain.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When we try to study the periods in Plotinos's
thought, as shown in his books, we are met with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1278" id="Page_1278">1278</a></span>
difficulties, which are chiefly due to Porphyry. Exactly
following the contemporary methods of the compilers
of the Bible, he undiscerningly confused the writings
of the various periods, so as to make up an anthology,
grouped by six groups of nine books each, according
to subjects, consisting first of ethical disquisitions;
second, of physical questions; third, of cosmic considerations;
fourth, of psychological discussions; fifth,
of transcendental lucubrations; and sixth, of metaphysics
and <span class="locked">theology.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></span> As the reader might guess
from the oversymmetrical grouping, and this pretty
classification, the apparent order is only illusory, as he
may have concluded from the fact that the discussions
of matter analyzed above are scattered throughout the
whole range of this anthology. The result of this Procrustean
arrangement was the same as with the Bible: a
confusion of mosaic, out of which pretty nearly anything
could be proved, and into which almost everything
has been read. Compare the outlines of the doctrines
of Plotinos by Ritter, Zeller, Ueberweg, Chaignet,
Mead, Guthrie, and Drews, and it will be seen that
there is very little agreement between them, while none
of them allow for the difference between the various
parts of the Enneads.</p>

<p>How fearful the confusion is, will best be realized
from the following two tables, made up from the indications
given in Porphyry's Life of Plotinos.</p>

<p>Porphyry gives three lists of the works of the
various periods. Identifying these in the present
Ennead arrangement, they are to be found as follows:</p>

<p>The works of the Amelian period are now i. 6; iv. 7;
iii. 1; iv. 2; v. 9; iv. 8; iv. 4; iv. 9; vi. 9; v. 1; v. 2;
ii. 4; iii. 9; ii. 2; iii. 4; i. 9; ii. 6; v. 7; i. 2; i. 3; i. 8.</p>

<p>The works of the Porphyrian period are now vi. 5, 6;
v. 6; ii. 5; iii. 6; iv. 3&ndash;5; iii. 8; v. 8; v. 5; ii. 9; vi. 6;
ii. 8; i. 5; ii. 7; vi. 7; vi. 8; ii. 1; iv. 6; vi. 1&ndash;3; iii. 7.</p>

<p>The works of the latest or Eustochian period are:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1279" id="Page_1279">1279</a></span>
i. 4; iii. 2, 3; v. 3; iii. 5; i. 8; ii. 3; i. 1; i. 7. (For
Eustochius, see Scholion to Enn. iv. 4.29, ii. 7.86,
Creuz. 1, 301 Kirchhof.)</p>

<p>A more convenient table will be the converse arrangement.
Following the present normal order of
the books in Enneads, we will describe its period by a
letter, referring to the Amelian period by A, to the
Porphyrian by P, and the Eustochian by E. I:
EAAEPAEAA. II: PAEAPAPPP. III: AEEAEAPPA.
IV: AAPPPPAAA. V: AAEAPPAPA. VI:
PPPPPPPPA.</p>

<p>This artificial arrangement into Enneads should
therefore be abandoned, and in a new English translation
that the writer has in mind, the books would
appear in the order of their periods, while an index
would allow easy reference by the old numbers. Then
only will we be able to study the successive changes of
Plotinos's thought, in their normal mutual relation; and
it is not difficult to prophesy that important results
would follow.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Having thus achieved internal proof of development
of doctrines in Plotinos, by examination of his
views about Matter, we may with some confidence
state that the externally known facts of the life of no
philosopher lend themselves to such a progress of
opinions more readily than that of Plotinos. His biographer,
Porphyry, as we have seen, had already given
us a list of the works of three easily characterized
periods in Plotinos's life: the period before Porphyry
came to him, the period while Porphyry staid with him,
and the later period when Plotinos was alone, and
Porphyry was in retirement (or banishment?) in
Sicily.</p>

<p>An external division into periods is therefore openly
acknowledged; but it remains for us to recall its
significance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1280" id="Page_1280">1280</a></span>
In the first place, the reader will ask himself, how
does it come about that Plotinos is so dependent on
Porphyry, and before him, on Amelius? The answer
is that Plotinos himself was evidently somewhat
deficient in the details of elementary education,
however much proficiency in more general philosophical
studies, and in independent thought, and personal
magnetic touch with pupils he may have
achieved. His pronunciation was defective, and in
writing he was careless, so much so that he usually
failed to affix proper headings or notice of definite
<span class="locked">authorship.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a></span> These peculiarities would to some extent
put him in the power, and under the influence of
his editors, and this explains why he was dependent
on Porphyry later, and Amelius <span class="locked">earlier.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></span> These
editors might easily have exerted potent, even if unconscious
or merely suggestive influence; but we know
that Porphyry did not scruple to add glosses of his
<span class="locked">own,<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></span> not to speak of hidden Stoic and Aristotelian
<span class="locked">pieces,<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></span> for he relied on Aristotle's "Metaphysics."
Besides, Plotinos was so generally accused of pluming
himself on writings of Numenius, falsely passed off as
his own, that it became necessary for Amelius to write
a book on the differences between Numenius and
Plotinos, and for Porphyry to defend his master, as
well as to quote a letter of Longinus on the <span class="locked">subject;<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></span>
but Porphyry does not deny that among the writings
of the Platonists Kronius, Caius, and Attikus, and the
Peripatetics Aspasius, Alexander and Adrastus, the
writings of Numenius also were used as texts in the
school of Plotinos (14).</p>

<p>Having thus shown the influence of the editors of
Plotinos, we must examine who and what they were.
Let us however first study the general trend of the
Plotinic career.</p>

<p>His last period was Stoic practise, for so zealously
did he practise austerities that his death was, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1281" id="Page_1281">1281</a></span>
least, hastened <span class="locked">thereby.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></span> It is unlikely that he would
have followed Stoic precepts without some sympathy
for, or acquaintance with their philosophical doctrines;
and as we saw above, Porphyry acknowledges Plotinos's
writings contain hidden Stoic <span class="locked">pieces.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></span> Then,
Plotinos spent the last period of his life in Rome, where
ruled, in philosophical circles, the traditions of Cicero,
Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<p>That these Stoic practices became fatal to him is
significant when we remember that this occurred during
the final absence of Porphyry, who may, during his
presence, have exerted a friendly restraint on the
zealous master. At any rate, it was during Porphyry's
regime that the chief works of Plotinos were written,
including a bitter diatribe against the Gnostics, who
remained the chief protagonists of dualism and belief
in positive evil. Prophyry's work, "De Abstinentia,"
proves clearly enough his Stoic sympathies.</p>

<p>Such aggressive enmity is too positive to be accounted
for by the mere removal to Rome from Alexandria,
and suggests a break of some sort with former
friends. Indications of such a break do exist, namely,
the permanent departure to his earlier home, Apamea,
of his former editor, Amelius. We <span class="locked">hear<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></span> of an incident
in which Amelius invited Plotinos to come and
take part in the New Moon <span class="locked">celebrations<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></span> of the
mysteries. Plotinos, however, refused, on the grounds
that "They must come to me, not I go to them." Then
we <span class="locked">hear<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a></span> of bad blood between this Amelius and
Porphyry, a long, bitter controversy, patched up, indeed,
but which cannot have failed to leave its mark.
Then this Amelius writes a book on the Differences
between Plotinos and Numenius, which, in a long
letter, he inscribes to <span class="locked">Porphyry,<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></span> as if the latter were
the chief one interested in these distinctions. Later,
Amelius, who before this seems to have been the chief
disciple and editor of Plotinos, departs, never to return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1282" id="Page_1282">1282</a></span>
his place being taken by Porphyry. It is not necessary
to possess a vivid imagination to read between the
lines, especially when Plotinos, in the last work of this
period, against the Gnostics, section 10, seems to refer
to friends of his who still held to other doctrines.</p>

<p>Now in order to understand the nature of the period
when Amelius was the chief disciple of Plotinos, we
must recall who Amelius was. In the first place, he
hailed from the home-town of Numenius, Apamea in
Syria. He had adopted as son Hostilianus-Hesychius,
who also hailed from Apamea. And it was to Apamea
that Amelius withdrew, after he left Plotinos. We are
therefore not surprised to learn that he had written
out almost all the books of Numenius, that he had
gathered them together, and learned most of them by
<span class="locked">heart.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></span> Then we learn from Proclus (see Zeller's
account) that Amelius taught the trine division of the
divine creator, exactly as did Numenius. Is it any
wonder, then, that he wrote a book on the differences
between Plotinos and Numenius at a later date, when
Porphyry had started a polemic with him? During
his period as disciple of Plotinos, twenty-four years in
duration, Plotinos would naturally have been under
Numenian influence of some kind, and we cannot be
very far wrong in thinking that this change of editors
must have left some sort of impress on the dreamy
thinker, Plotinos, ever seeking to experience an ecstasy.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In this account of the matter we have restrained
ourselves from mentioning one of the strangest coincidences
in literature, which would have emphasized
the nature of the break of Amelius with Plotinos, for
the reason that it may be no more than a chance pun;
but that even as such it must have been present to the
actors in that drama, there is no doubt. We read
above that Amelius invited Plotinos to accompany him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1283" id="Page_1283">1283</a></span>
to attend personally the mystery-celebrations at the
"noumênia," a time sacred to such <span class="locked">celebrations.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></span> But
this was practically the name of Numenius, and the
text might well have been translated that Amelius invited
him to visit the celebrations as Numenius would
have done; and indeed, from all we know of Numenius,
with his initiation at Eleusis and in Egypt, that is
just of what we might have supposed he would have
approved. In other words, we would discover
Amelius in the painful act of choice between the two
great influences of his life, Numenius, and Plotinos.
Moreover, that the incident was important is revealed
by Porphyry's calling Plotinos's answer a "great
word," which was much commented on, and long
remembered.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In thus dividing the career of Plotinos in the Amelian,
the Porphyrian, and Eustochian (98) we meet
however one very interesting difficulty. The Plotinic
writings by Porphyry assigned to the last or Eustochian
period are those which internal criticism would lead
us to assign to his very earliest philosophising; and in
our study of the development of the Plotinic views
about Matter, we have taken the liberty of considering
them as the earliest. We are however consoled in our
regret at having to be so radical, by noticing that
Porphyry, to whom we are indebted for our knowledge
of the periods of the works, has done the same thing.
He says that he has assigned the earliest place in each
Ennead to the easier and simpler <span class="locked">discussions;<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></span> yet
these latest-issued works of Plotinos are assigned to
the very beginning of each Ennead, four going to the
First Ennead, one to the Second, three to the Third,
and one only to the Fifth. If these had been the
crowning works of the Master's life, especially the
treatise on the First God and Happiness, it would have
been by him placed at the very end of all, and not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1284" id="Page_1284">1284</a></span>
the beginning. Porphyry must therefore have possessed
some external knowledge which would agree
with the conclusions of our internal criticism, which
follows.</p>

<p>These Eustochian works make the least use of Stoic,
or even Aristotelian terms, most closely following even
the actual words of Numenius. For instance, we may
glance at the very first book of the First Ennead, which
though of the latest period, is thoroughly Numenian.</p>

<p>The first important point is the First Divinity "hovering
over" <span class="locked">Being,<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></span> using the same word as <span class="locked">Numenius.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></span>
This was suggested by Prof. Thedinga. However, he
applied the words "he says" to Numenius; but this
cannot be the case, as a Platonic quotation immediately.</p>

<p>The whole subject of the Book is the composite
soul, and this is thoroughly <span class="locked">Numenian.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></span></p>

<p>Then we have the giving without <span class="locked">return.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a></span></p>

<p>Then we find the pilot-simile as illustration for the
relation of soul to <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></span> although in Numenius it
appears of the Logos and the world.</p>

<p>We find the animal divided in two souls, the irrational
and the <span class="locked">rational,<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a></span> which reminds us of Numenius's
division into two <span class="locked">souls.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></span></p>

<p>The soul consists of a peculiar kind of motion, which
however is entirely different from that of other bodies,
which is its own <span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></span> This reminds us of Numenius's
still-standing of the Supreme, which however is simultaneously
innate <span class="locked">motion.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></span></p>

<p>Referring to the problem, discussed elsewhere, that
these Plotinic works of the latest or Eustochian period,
are the most Numenian, which we would be most likely
to attribute to his early or formative stage, rather than
to the last or perfected period, it is interesting to notice
that these works seem to imply other works of the
Amelian or Porphyrian periods, by the <span class="locked">words,<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></span> "It has
been said," or treated of, referring evidently to several
<span class="locked">passages.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></span> Still this need not necessarily refer to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1285" id="Page_1285">1285</a></span>
later work, it may even refer to Plato, or even to
Numenius's allegory of the Cave of the <span class="locked">Nymphs,<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a></span>
where the descent of the souls is most definitely studied.
Or it might even refer to Num. 35a, where birth or
genesis is referred to as the wetting of the souls in the
matter of bodies.</p>

<p>Moreover, they contain an acknowledgment, and a
study of positive evil, something which would be very
unlikely after his elaborate explaining away of evil in
his treatise against the Gnostics, of the Porphyrian
period, and his last treatment of Matter, where he is
even willing to grant the possibility of matter possessing
Being. The natural process for any thinker must
ever be to begin with comparative imitation of his
master, and then to progress to independent treatment
of the subject. But for the process to be reversed is
hardly likely.</p>

<p>Moreover, when we examine these Eustochian works
in detail, they hardly seem to be such as would be
the expressions of the last years of an ecstatic, suffering
intense agony at times, his interest already directed
heavenwards. The discussion of astrology must date
from the earliest association with Gnostics, in Alexandria,
who also might have inspired or demanded a
special treatment of the nature of evil, which later he
consistently denied. Then there is an amateurish
treatment of anthropology in general, which the cumulatively-arranging
Porphyry puts at the very beginning
of the First Book. The treatise on the First Good and
Happiness, is not unlike a beginner's first attempt at
writing out his body of divinity, as George Herbert
said, and Porphyry also puts it at the beginning. The
Eros-article is only an amplification of Platonic myths,
indeed making subtler distinctions, still not rising to
the heights of pure, subjective speculation.</p>

<p>These general considerations may be supplemented
by a few more definite indications. It is in the Eros-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1286" id="Page_1286">1286</a></span>article
that we find the Platonic myth of Poros and
Penia. Yet these reappear in the earliest Amelian
treatment of matter (ii. 4), as a sort of echo, mentioned
only by the way, as if they had been earlier
thoroughly threshed out. Here also we find only a
stray, incidental use of the term "hypostasis," whereas
the Stoic language in other Amelian and Porphyrian
treatises has already been pointed out.</p>

<p>We are therefore driven to the following, very
human and natural conclusion. Plotinos's first attempts
at philosophical writing had consisted of chiefly
Numenian disquisitions, which would be natural in
Alexandria, where Numenius had probably resided, and
had left friends and successors among the Gnostics.
When Plotinos went to Rome, he took these writings
with him, but was too absorbed in new original Amelian
treatises to resurrect his youthful Numenian attempts,
which he probably did not value highly, as being the
least original, and because they taught doctrines he
had left behind in his Aristotelian and Stoic progress.
He laid them aside. Only when Porphyry had left
him, and he felt the increasing feebleness due to old
age and Stoic austerities, did his attendant Eustochius
urge him to preserve these early works. Plotinos was
willing, and sent them to Sicily where Porphyry had
retired. And so it happened with Plotinos, as it has
happened with many another writer, that the last
things became first, and the first became last.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The idea of classifying the works of Plotinos chronologically,
therefore, has so much external proof, as
well as internal indications, to support it, that, no
doubt, in the future no reference will be made to
Plotinos without specifying to which period it refers;
and we may expect that future editions of his works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1287" id="Page_1287">1287</a></span>
will undo the grievous confusion introduced by Porphyry,
and thus render Plotinos's works comparatively
accessible to rational study.</p>

<p>There are besides many other minor proofs of the
chronological order of the writings of Plotinos, most of
which are noticed at the heading of each succeeding
book; but the most startling human references are
those to Amelius's departure as a false <span class="locked">friend;<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a></span> to
Porphyry's desire to suicide at his <span class="locked">departure,<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></span> and to
his own impending <span class="locked">dissolution,<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></span> each of these occurring
at the exact time of the event chronologically,
but certainly not according to the traditional order.</p>

<h2>II. PLATONISM: SIGNIFICANCE, PROGRESS AND
RESULTS.</h2>

<p>Of all fetishes which have misled humanity, perhaps
none is responsible for more error than that of originality.
As if anything could be new that was true, or
true that was new! The only possible lines along
which novelty or progress can lie are our reports,
combinations, and expressions. Some people think
they have done for a poet if they have shown that he
made use of suitable materials in the construction of
his poem! So Shakespeare has been shown to have
used whole scenes from earlier writers. So Virgil, by
Macrobius, has been shown to have laid under contribution
every writer then known to be worth ransacking.
Dante has also been shown to have re-edited
contemporary apocalypses. So Homer, even, has been
shown to re-tell stories gathered from many sources.
The result is that people generally consider Shakespeare,
Virgil, or Homer great in spite of their borrowings,
when, on the contrary, the statement should
be that they were great because of their rootage in
the best of their period. In other words, they are
great not because of their own personality (which in
many cases has dropped out of the ken of history),
but because they more faithfully, completely, and harmoniously
represent their periods than other now forgotten
writers. Therein alone lay their cosmic value,
and their assurance of immortality. They are the
voices of their ages, and we are interested in the significance
of their age, not in them personally.</p>

<p>It is from this standpoint that we must approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1289" id="Page_1289">1289</a></span>
Plato. Of his personality what details are known are
of no soteriologic significance; and the reason why the
world has not been able to get away from him, and
probably never will, is that he sums up prior Greek
philosophy in as coherent a form as is possible without
doing too great Procrustean violence to the elements
in question. This means that Plato did not fuse them
all into one absolutely, rigid, coherent, consistent system,
in which case his utility would have been very
much curtailed. The very form of his writings, the
dialogue, left each element in the natural living condition
to survive on its merits, not as an authoritative
oracle, or Platonic pronunciamento, or creed.</p>

<p>For details, the reader is referred to Zeller's fuller
account of these pre-Platonic <span class="locked">elements.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></span> But we may
summarize as follows: the physical elements to which
the Hylicists had in turn attributed finality Plato united
into Pythagorean matter, which remained as an element
of Dualism. The world of nature became the becoming
of Heraclitus. Above that he placed the Being
of Parmenides, in which the concepts of Socrates found
place as ideas. These he identified with the numbers
and harmonies of Pythagoras, and united them in an
Eleatic unity of many, as an intelligible world, or
reason, which he owed to Anaxagoras. The chief
idea, that of the Good, was Megaro-Socratic. His
cosmology was that of Timaeus. His psychology was
based on Anaxagoras, as mind; on Pythagoras, as
immortal. His ethics are Socratic, his politics are
Pythagorean. Who therefore would flout Plato, has
all earlier Greek philosophy to combat; and whoever
recognizes the achievements of the Hellenic mind will
find something to praise in Plato. When, therefore,
we are studying Platonism, we are only studying a
blending of the rays of Greece, and we are chiefly
interested in Greece as one of the latest, clearest, and
most kindred expressions of human thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1290" id="Page_1290">1290</a></span>
If however we should seek some one special Platonic
element, it would be that genuineness of reflection,
that sincerity of thought, that makes of his dialogues
no cut and dried literary figments, but soul-tragedies,
with living, breathing, interest and emotion. Plato
thus practised his doctrine of the double <span class="locked">self,<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a></span> the
higher and the lower selves, of which the higher might
be described as "superior to oneself." In his later
period, that of the Laws, he applied this double psychology
to cosmology, thereby producing doubleness in
the world-Soul: besides the good one, appears the evil
one, which introduces even into heaven things that are
not good.</p>

<p>It was only a step from this to the logical deduction
of Xenocrates that these things in heaven were "spirits"
or "guardians," both good and evil, assisting in the
administration of human <span class="locked">affairs.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a></span> Such is the result
of doubleness introduced into anthropology; introduced
into cosmology, it establishes Pythagorean indefinite
duality as the principle opposing the unity of
goodness.</p>

<p>The next step was taken by Plutarch. The evil
demons, had, in Stoic phraseology, been called "physical;"
and so, in regard to matter, they came to stand
in the relation of soul to body. Original matter, therefore,
became two-fold; matter itself, and its moving
principle, "the soul of matter." This was identified
with the worse World-soul by a development, or historical
event, which was the ordering of the cosmos, or,
creation.</p>

<p>This then was the state of affairs at the advent of
Numenius. Although his chief interest lay in practical
comparative religion, he tried, philosophically, to return
to a mythical "original" Platonism or Pythagoreanism.
What Plato did for earlier Greek speculation,
Numenius did for post-Platonic development. He
harked back to the latter Platonic stage, which taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1291" id="Page_1291">1291</a></span>
the evil world-Soul. He included the achievements of
Plutarch, the "soul of matter," and the trine division
of a separate principle, such as Providence. To the
achievement of Xenocrates he was drawn by two
powerful interests, the Egyptian, Hermetic, Serapistic,
in connection with the evil demons; and the Pythagorean,
in connection with the Indefinite-duality. Thus
Numenius's History of the Platonic Succession is not a
delusion; Numenius really did sum up the positive
Platonic progress, not omitting even Maximus of Tyre's
philosophical hierarchic explanation of the emanative
or participative streaming forth of the Divine. But
Numenius was not merely a philosopher: of this gathering
of Platonic achievements he made a religion. In
this he was also following the footsteps of Pythagoras,
who limited his doctrines to a group of students. But
Numenius did not merely copy Pythagoras. Numenius
modernized him, connecting up the Platonic doctrinal
aggregate with the mystery-rites current in his own
day. Nor did Numenius shirk any unpleasant responsibilities
of a restorer of Platonism: he continued
the traditional Academico-Stoical feud. Strange to say,
the last great Stoic philosopher, Posidonius (A.D. 135&ndash;151)
hailed from Numenius's home-town, Apamea, so
that this Stoic feud may have been forced on Numenius
from home personalities or conditions. It would seem
that in Numenius and Posidonius we have a re-enactment
of the tragedy of Greek philosophy on a Syrian
theatre, where dogmatic Stoicism died, and Platonism
admitted Oriental ideas.</p>

<p>Apamea, however, had not yet ended its role in the
development of thought. Numenius's pupil, Amelius,
had gathered, copied, and learned by heart his master's
works. It was in Apamea that he adopted as son
Hostilianius-Hesychius. After a twenty-four years'
sojourn in Rome he returned to Apamea, and was
dwelling there still at the time of the death of Plotinos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1292" id="Page_1292">1292</a></span>
with whom he had spent that quarter of a century.
Here then we have a historical basis for a connection
between Numenius and Plotinos, which we have elsewhere
endeavored to demonstrate from inner grounds.</p>

<p>It was however by Amelius that philosophy is drawn
into the maelstrom of the world-city. Plotinos, in his
early periods a Numenian Platonist, will later go over
to Stoicism, and conduct a polemic with the Gnostics,
the Alexandrian heirs of Platonic dualism, under the
influence of the Stoic Porphyry. However, Plotinos
will not publicly abandon Platonism; he will fuse the
two streams of thought, and interpret in Stoic terms
the fundamentals of Platonism, producing something
which, when translated into Latin, he will leave as
inheritance to all the ages. Not in vain, therefore, did
Amelius transport the torch of philosophy to the
Capital.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Let us in a few words dispose of the general outlines
of the fate of the Platonic movement.</p>

<p>Plotinos was no religious leader; he was before
everything else a philosopher, even if he centred his
efforts on the practical aspects of the ecstatic union
with God. Indeed, Porphyry relates to us the incident
in which this matter was objectively exemplified. At
the New Moon, Amelius invited him to join in a visit
to the mystery celebrations. Plotinos refused, saying
that "they would have to come to him, not he go over
to them." This then is the chief difference between
Numenius and Plotinos, and the result would be a
recrudescence of pure philosophic contentions, as those
of Plotinos against the Gnostics.</p>

<p>As to the general significance of Plotinos, we must
here resume what we have elsewhere detailed: that
with the change of editors, from Amelius to Porphyry,
Plotinos changed from Numenian or Pythagorean dualism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1293" id="Page_1293">1293</a></span>
to Stoic monism, in which the philosophic feud was
no longer with the Stoics, but with the Alexandrian
descendants of Numenian dualism, the Gnostics. Even
though Plotinos showed practical religious aspects in
his studying and experiencing the ecstasy, there is no
record of any of his pupils being encouraged to do so,
and therefore Plotinos remains chiefly a philosopher.</p>

<p>The successors of Plotinos could not remain on this
purely philosophic standpoint. Instead of practising
the ecstasy, they followed the Gnostics in theorizing
about practical religious reality in their cosmology and
theology, which took on, more or less, the shape of
magic, not inconsiderably aided by Stoic allegoric interpretations
of myths, as in Porphyry's "Cave of the
Nymphs."</p>

<p>What Plato did for early Greek philosophy, what
Numenius did for post-Platonic thought, that Proclus
Diadochus, the "Successor," did for Plotinos and his
followers. For the first time since Numenius we find
again a comparative method. By this time religion
and philosophy have fused in magic, and so, instead of
a comparative religion, we have a comparative philosophy.
Proclus was the first genuine commentator,
quoting authorities on all sides. He was sufficient of
a philosopher to grasp Neoplatonism as a school of
thought; and far from paying any attention to Ammonius,
as recent philosophy has done, as source of
Neoplatonism, he traces the movement as far as
Plutarch, calling him the "father of us all," inasmuch
as he introduced the conception of "hypostasis."
Evidently, Proclus looked upon this as the centre of
Neoplatonic development, and therefore we shall be
justified in a closer study of this conception; and we
may even say that its historic destiny was a continuation
of the main stream of creative Greek philosophy;
or, if you prefer, of Platonism, or Noumenianism, or
even Plotinian thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1294" id="Page_1294">1294</a></span>
Did Greek philosophy die with Proclus? The
political changes of the time forced alteration of dialect
and position; but the accumulations of mental achievements
could not perish. This again we owe to Proclus.
Besides being the first great commentator he precipitated
his most valuable achievements in logical form,
in analytic arrangement, in the form of crystal-clear
propositions, theorems, demonstrations, and corollaries.
Such a highly abstract form was inevitable, inasmuch
as Numenius had turned away from Aristotelian observation
of nature. Just like the Hebrew thinkers,
who finally became commentators and abstract theorizers,
nothing else was left for a philosophy without
connection with experiment, when whittled down by
the keenest intellects of the times.</p>

<p>This abstract method, still familiarly used by geometry,
reappeared among the School-men, notably in
Thomas Aquinas. Later it persisted with Spinoza and
Descartes. However, rising experimentalism has
gradually terminated it, its last form appearing in Kant
and Hegel. Kant's "Ding in sich," reached after abstracting
all qualities, is only a re-statement of Numenius
and Plotinos's "subject," or, definition of
matter; and Hegel's dialectic, beginning with Being and
Not-being, more definitely proclaimed by Plotinos,
goes as far back as the Eleatics and Heraclitus, not to
mention Plato. However, Kant and Hegel are the
great masters of modern thought; and although at one
time the rising tide of materialism and cruder forms of
evolution threatened to obscure it, Karl Pearson's
"Grammar of Science," generous as it is in invective
against Kant and Hegel, in modern terms clinches
Berkeley's and Kant's demonstration of the reality of
the super-sensual, thus vindicating Plotinos, and, before
him, Numenius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1295" id="Page_1295">1295</a></span>
It must not be supposed that in thus tracing the
springs of our modern thought we necessarily approve
of all the thought of Plotinos, Numenius or Plato. On
the contrary, they were far more likely to have committed
logical errors than we are, because they were
hypnotized by the glamor of the terms they used,
which to us are mere laboratory tools. The best way
to prove this will be to appraise at its logical value for
us Plotinos's discussion of Matter, elsewhere studied
in its value for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1296" id="Page_1296">1296</a></span></p>
<h2>III. PLOTINOS'S VIEW OF MATTER.</h2>

<p>We have elsewhere pointed out the hopelessness of
escaping either aspect of the problem of the One and
the Many; and that the attempt of the Stoics to avoid
the Platonic dualism by a materialistic monism was
merely a change of names, the substance of the dualism
remaining as the opposition of the contraries, such
as active and passive, male and female, the predominant
<span class="locked">elements,<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></span> etc. Plotinos, in his abandonment of
Numenian dualism, and championing of Stoicism,
undertaking the feud with the Gnostics, the successors
of Numenius, must therefore have inherited the same
difficulties of thought, and we shall see how in spite of
his mental agility he is caught in the same traditional
meshes, and that these irreducible difficulties occur in
each one of his three periods of life, the Eustochian,
the Amelian, and the Porphyrian.</p>

<p>In the Amelian, he teaches two matters, the physical
and the intelligible, by which device he seeks to avoid
the difficulties of dualism, crediting to intelligible matter
any necessary form of Being, thus pushing physical
matter into the outer darkness of non-being. So intelligible
matter is still a form of Being, and we still
hold to monism; as intelligible matter may participate
in the good; while matter physical remains evil, being
a deprivation of good, not possessing it. This, of
course is dualism; and he thus has a convenient pun on
the word matter, by which he can be monist or dualist,
as the fancy takes him, or as exigencies demand. This
participation, therefore, does not eliminate the dualism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1297" id="Page_1297">1297</a></span>
while formally professing monism. Therefore Plotinos
tries to choose between monism and dualism by surreptitiously
accepting both.</p>

<p>In the Porphyrian period, he rejected the idea of intelligible
<span class="locked">matter.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></span> Forced to fashion entirely new
arguments, he seizes as tool the Aristotelian distinction
between potentiality and actuality, or energy as dynamic
<span class="locked">accomplishment.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a></span> But no logical device can help
a man to pull himself up by his boot-straps. If by
Being you mean existence, then its opposite must be
negative, and to speak of real non-being, as something
that shares being, is an evasion. To say that matter
remains non-being, while having the possibility of
future Being, which however can never be actualized,
is mere juggling with words. Even if matter is no
more than a weak, confused image, it is not non-being.
If it is a positive lie, it is not non-being. To
talk of a higher degree of Non-being, that is real non-being,
is simply to confuse the actuality intended with
the thought of non-being, which of course is a thought
as actually existing as any other. Moreover if matter
is imperishable, it cannot be non-being; and if it possesses
Being potentially, it certainly is not non-existence.
The Aristotelian potentiality could help to
create this evasion, but did not remove its real nature;
it merely supplied Plotinos with an intellectual device
to characterize something that would not be actually
existing as still having the possibility of existence; but
this is not non-existence. In another <span class="locked">writing<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></span> of this
period Plotinos continues his evasions about the origin
and nature of matter. First, he grants that it is something
that is not original, being later than many
earthly, and all intelligible objects; although, if he had
returned to the conception of intelligible matter, he
would have been at liberty to assert the originality of
the latter. Then he holds that Being is common to
both form and matter, as to quality, but not as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1298" id="Page_1298">1298</a></span>
quantity. Last, he closes the paragraph by saying that
perhaps form and matter do not come from the same
origin, as there is a difference between them.</p>

<p>In Plotinos's third, or Eustochian period, the same
evasions occur. For <span class="locked">instance<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a></span> he limits Being to goodness.
Then he acknowledges the existence of evil
things, and derives their evil quality from a primary
evil, the "image of essence," the Being of evil. That
he is conscious of having strained a point is evident
from the fact that he adds the clause, "if there can be
a Being of evil." <span class="locked">Likewise,<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a></span> while discussing evil,
which is generally recognized because in our daily lives
there is positive pain, and sensations of pain, he defines
evil as lack of qualities. To say that evil is not such
as to form, but as to nature is opposite to form is
nonsense, inasmuch as life is full of positive evils, as
Numenius brought out in 16, and Plotinos acknowledged
even in spite of his polemic against the Gnostics.</p>

<p>Finally Plotinos takes refuge in a <span class="locked">miracle<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a></span> as explanation
of "unparticipating participation." This is
commentary enough; it shows he realized the futility
of any arguments. But Plotinos was not alone in
despairing of establishing an ironclad system; before
him Numenius had, just as pathetically, despaired of a
logical dualism, and he acknowledged in fragment 16
that Pythagoras's arguments, however true, were
"wonderful and opposed to the belief of a majority of
humanity."</p>

<p>In other words, monism is as unsatisfactory to
reason as dualism. This was the chief point of agreement
between Pythagoras and the Stoics; and Pragmatism
has in modern times attempted to show a way
out by a higher sanction of another kind.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader may be interested in a side-light
on this subject. Drews is interested in Plotinos only
because Plotinos's super-rational divinity furnishes a
historical foundation for Edouard Hartmann's philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1299" id="Page_1299">1299</a></span>
of the Unconscious. It would seem, however,
to be a mistake to use the latter term, for it is true
only as a doubtful corollary. If the Supreme is super-conscious,
it is possible to describe this logically as
unconscious. But generally, however, unconsciousness
is a term used to denote the sub-conscious, rather than
the super-conscious, and the use of that term must
inevitably entail misunderstandings. It would be better
then to follow Pragmatism into the super-conscious,
rather than to sink with Hartmann into the sub-conscious.
It was directly from <span class="locked">Plotinos<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a></span> that Hartmann
took his expression "beyond good and evil."</p>

<p>Having watched Numenius, for Platonic dualism;
and Plotinos for Stoic monism, both appeal to a
miracle as court of last resort, we may now return to
that result of Platonism which has left the most vital
impress on our civilization, its conception of the divine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1300" id="Page_1300">1300</a></span></p>
<h2>IV. PLOTINOS'S CREATION OF THE TRINITY.</h2>

<p>Elsewhere we have seen how Numenius waged the
traditional Academic feud with the Stoics bravely, but
uselessly, inasmuch as it was chiefly a difference of
dialects that separated them. In the course of this
struggle, Numenius had made certain distinctions within
the divinity, which were followed by Amelius, but are
difficult to trace in Plotinos because, as a matter of
principle, <span class="locked">Plotinos<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></span> was averse to thus "dividing the
divinity." Why so? Because he was waging a
struggle with the Gnostics, who had followed in the
footsteps of the Hermetic writings (with their Demiurge
and Seven Governors); Philo Judaeus (with his five
Subordinate Powers); Numenius and Amelius (with
their triply divided First and Second gods);&mdash;after
which we come to Basilides (with his seven Powers);
Saturninus (with his Seven Angels); and Valentinus
(with his 33 Aeons).</p>

<p>This new feud between Plotinos and the Gnostics is
however just as illusory as the earlier one between
Numenius and the Stoics. It was merely a matter of
dialects. Plotinos indeed found fault with the Gnostics
for making divisions within the Divinity; but wherever
he himself is considering the divinity minutely, he, just
as much as the Gnostics, is compelled to draw distinctions,
even though he avoided acknowledged
divisions by borrowing from Plutarch a new, non-Platonic,
non-Numenian, but Aristotelian, Stoic (Cornutus
and Sextus) and still Alexandrian (Philo, Septuagint,
Lucian) term "hypostasis."</p>

<p>The difference he pretended to find between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1301" id="Page_1301">1301</a></span>
Gnostic distinctions within the Divinity and his new
term hypostasis was that the former introduced manifoldness
into the divinity, by splitting <span class="locked">Him,<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a></span> thus allowing
the influence of matter to pervade the pure realm
of Being. Hypostasis, on the contrary, wholly existed
within the realm of pure Being, and was no more than
a trend, a direction, a characterization, a function, a
face, or orientation of activity of the unaffected unity
of Being. Thus the divinity retained its unity, and
still could be active in several directions, without admixture
of what philosophy had till then recognized as
constituting manifoldness. But reflection shows that
this is a mere quibble, an evasion, a paralogism, a
quaternio terminorum, a pun. How it came about we
shall attempt to show below.</p>

<p>In thus achieving a manifoldness in the divinity
without divisions, Plotinos did indeed keep out of the
divinity the splitting influence of matter, which it was
now possible to banish to the realm of unreality, as a
negation, and a lie. Monism was thus achieved ...
but at the cost of two errors: denial of the common-sense
reality of the phenomenal <span class="locked">world,<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a></span> and that
quibble about three hypostases without manifoldness,
genuinely a "distinction without a difference."</p>

<p>This intellectual dishonesty must not however be
foisted on <span class="locked">Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a></span> or Plutarch. The latter, for <span class="locked">instance,<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></span>
adopted this term only to denote the primary
and original characteristics (or distinctions within)
existing things, from a comparative study of Aristotle's
"de Anima," and Plato's <span class="locked">"Phaedo."<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a></span> These five
hypostases were the divinity, mind, soul, forms immanent
in inorganic nature, "hexis," in Stoic dialect,
and to matter, as apart from these forms.</p>

<p>So important to Neoplatonism did this term seem to
Proclus, that he did not hesitate to say that Plutarch,
by the use thereof, became "our first forefather." He
therefore develops it further. Among the hidden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1302" id="Page_1302">1302</a></span>
intelligible gods are three hypostases. The first is
characterized by the Good; it thinks the Good itself,
and dwells with the paternal Monad. The second is
characterized by knowledge, and resides in the first
thought; while the third is characterized by beauty, and
dwells with the most beautiful of the intelligible.
They are the causes from which proceed three monads
which are self-existent but under the form of a unity,
and as in a germ, in their cause. Where they manifest,
they take a distinct form: faith, truth, and love
(Cousin's title: "Du Vrai, du Beau, et du Bien").
This trinity pervades all the divine worlds.</p>

<p>In order to understand the attitude of Plotinos on
the subject, we must try to put ourselves in his position.
In the first place, on Porphyry's own admission, he
had added to Platonism Peripatetic and Stoic views.
From Aristotle his chief borrowings were the categories
of form and matter, and the distinction between potentiality
and <span class="locked">actuality,<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></span> as well as the Aristotelian psychology
of various souls. To the Stoics he was drawn
by their monism, which led him to drop the traditional
Academico-Stoic feud, or rather to take the side of the
Stoics against Numenius the Platonist dualist and the
dualistic successors, the Gnostics. But there was a
difference between the Stoics and Plotinos. The Stoics
assimilated spirit to matter, while Plotinos, reminiscent
of Plato, preferred to assimilate matter to spirit. Still,
he used their terminology, and categories, including
the conception of a hypostasis, or form of existence.
With this equipment, he held to the traditional Platonic
trinity of the "Letters," the King, the intellect, and the
soul. Philosophically, however, he had received from
Numenius the inheritance of a double name of the
Divinity, Being and Essence. As a thinker, he was
therefore forced to accommodate Numenius to Plato,
and by adding to Numenius's name of the divinity, to
complete Numenius's theology by Numenius's own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1303" id="Page_1303">1303</a></span>
cosmology. This then he did by adding as third hypostasis
the Aristotelian dynamic energy.</p>

<p>But as Intellect is permanent, how can Energy arise
therefrom? Here this eternal puzzle is solved by distinguishing
energy into indwelling and out-flowing. As
indwelling, Energy constitutes Intellect; but its energetic
nature could not be demonstrated except by out-flowing,
which produces a distinction.</p>

<p>Similarly, there are two kinds of heat, that of the
fire itself, and that emitted by the fire, so that the
fire may remain itself while exerting its influence without.
It is thus also there: in that it remains itself in its
inmost being, and from its own inherent perfection,
and energy, the developed energy assumes hypostasis,
as if from a Dynamis that is great, nay, greatest; and
so it joins the Essence and the Being. For that was
beyond all Being, and that was the Dynamis of all
things, and already was all things. If then it is all, it
must be above all; consequently also above Being.
"And if this is all, then the One is before all; not of an
essence equal to all, and this must be above Being, as
this is above intellect; for there is something above
<span class="locked">intellect."<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a></span></p>

<p>This is the most definite statement of Plotinos's
solution of the problem; other references thereto are
abundant. So we have a trinity of energy, being and
<span class="locked">essence,<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></span> and each of us, like the world-Soul has an

God, nous, and essence. The Nous is activity, and

the King, the nous, and the <span class="locked">soul.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a></span> We find energy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1304" id="Page_1304">1304</a></span><a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a>
thinking and being, <span class="locked">then<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></span> the soul, the nous, and the
One. We find Providence threefold (as in Plutarch)<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a>
and three ranks of Gods, demons and <span class="locked">world-life.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a></span>
Elsewhere, untheologically, or, rather, merely philosophically,
he speaks of the hypostasis of <span class="locked">wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a></span></p>

<p>Chaignet's summary of this <span class="locked">is<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></span> <span class="locked">that<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a></span> Plotinos holds
that every force in the intelligible is both Being and
Substance simultaneously; and reciprocally that no
Being, could be conceived without hypostasis, or
directed force. <span class="locked">Again,<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></span> the world, the universe of
things, contains three natures or divine hypostases,
soul, mind and unity; which indeed are found in our
own nature, and of which the divinest is unity or
divinity.</p>

<p>Let us now try to understand the matter. Why
should the word hypostasis, which unquestionably in
earlier times meant "substance," have later come to
mean "distinctions" within the divinity? For "substance,"
on the contrary, represents to our mind an
unity, the underlying unity, and not individual forms
of existence. How did the change occur?</p>

<p>Now Plotinos, as we remember, found fault with the
Gnostics in that they taught distinctions within the
<span class="locked">divinity.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></span> He would therefore be disposed to remove
from within the divinity those distinctions of Plotinic,
Plutarchian, Numenian, or Gnostic theology; although
he himself in early times did not scruple to speak of a
hypostasis of wisdom, or of Eros, or other matter he
might be considering. Such terms of Numenius or
Amelius as he seems to ignore are the various Demiurges;
the three Plutarchian Providences he himself
still uses. Still, all these terms he would be disposed to
eradicate from within the divinity.</p>

<p>As a constructive metaphysician, however, he could
not well get along without some titles for the different
phases of the divinity; and even if he dispensed with
the old names, there would still remain as their underlying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1305" id="Page_1305">1305</a></span>
support the reality or substance of the distinction.
So he removed the offensive, aggressive, historically
known and recognized terms, while leaving their
underlying substances, or supports. Now "substance"
had become "substances," and to differentiate these it
was necessary to interpret them as differing forms of
existence. The change was most definitely made by
Athanasius, who at a synod in Alexandria, in A.D.
<span class="locked">362,<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a></span> fastened on the church, as synonymous with
hypostasis the popular term "prosopon" or "face."
That this was an innovation appears from the fact that
the Nicene Council had stated that it was heretical to
say that Christ was of a hypostasis different from that
of the Father, in which case the word evidently meant
still the original underlying (singular) substance.
With this official definition in vogue, the original
(singular) substance became forgotten, and it became
possible to speak in the plural, of three faces, as indeed
Plotinos had done.</p>

<p>In other words, so necessary were distinctions in the
divinity, that the popular mind supplied other individual
names to designate the distinctions Plotinos had
successfully banished, for Demiurges and Providences
no longer return. Thus more manifold differences re-entered
into the divinity, than Plotinos had ever
emptied out of it, although under a name which the
poverty of the Latin language rendered as "persons,"
which represents to us individual consciousness of a
far more distinctive kind than was ever implied in
three phases of Providence, or of the Demiurge. Thus
the translation into Latin clinched the illicit linguistic
process, and the result of Plotinos's attempt to distinguish
in the Divinity phases so subtle as not to
demand or allow of manifoldness, resulted in the most
pronounced differences of personality. This was
finally clinched by Plotinos's illustration of the three
faces around a single <span class="locked">head,<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a></span> which established the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1306" id="Page_1306">1306</a></span>
idea of three "persons" (masks, from "per-sonare")
in one God.</p>

<p>Not only in the abstract realm of Metaphysics,
therefore, is the world indebted to Greek thought; but
even in the realm of religion a Stoic reinterpretation
of Platonism, itself reinterpreted in a different language
has given a lasting inheritance to the spiritual aspirations
of the ages.</p>

<h2>V. RESEMBLANCES TO CHRISTIANITY.</h2>

<h3>TRINITARIAN SIGNIFICANCE OF PLOTINOS.</h3>

<p>Plotinos's date being about A.D. 262, he stands
midway between the Christian writings of the New
Testament, and the Council of Nicaea, A.D. 325. As
a philosopher dealing with the kindred topics&mdash;the
soul and its salvation,&mdash;and deriving terminology and
inspiration from the same sources, Platonism and
Stoicism, we would expect extensive parallelism and
correspondence. Though Plotinos does not mention any
contemporaneous writings, we will surely be able to
detect indirect references to Old and New Testaments.
But what will be of most vital interest will be his anticipations
of Nicene formulations, or reflection of
current expressions of Christian philosophic comment.
While we cannot positively assert this Christian development
was exclusively Plotinian, we are justified
in saying that the development of Christian philosophy
was not due exclusively to the Alexandrian catechetical
school; that what later appears as Christian
theology was only earlier current Neoplatonic metaphysics,
without any exclusive dogmatic connection
with the distinctively Christian biography. This avoids
the flat assertion of Drews that the Christian doctrine
of the Trinity was dependent on Plotinos, although it
admits Bouillet's more cautious statement that Plotinos
was the rationalizer of the doctrine of the <span class="locked">Trinity.<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a></span>
This much is certain, that no other contemporaneous
discussion of the trinity has survived, if any ever existed;
and we must remember that it was not until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1308" id="Page_1308">1308</a></span>
council of Constantinople in A.D. 381, that the Nicene
Creed, by the addition of the Filioque clause, became
trinitarian in a thoroughgoing way; and not until fifty
years later that Augustine, again in the West, fully
expressed a philosophy and psychology of the trinity.</p>

<p>To Plotinos therefore is due the historical position
of protagonist of trinitarian philosophy.</p>

<h3>NON-CHRISTIAN ORIGIN OF PARALELLISMS TO
CHRISTIANITY.</h3>

<p>Christian parallelisms in Plotinos have a historical
origin in Christian parallelisms in his sources, namely,
Stoicism, Numenius and Plato.</p>

<p>To Christian origins in Plato never has justice been
done, not even by Bigg. His suggestion of the crucifixion
of the just man, his reference to the son of
God are only common-places, to which should be
added many minor references.</p>

<p>The Christian origins in Numenius are quite explicit;
mention of the Hebrews as among the races whose
scriptures are important, of Moses among the great
religious teachers, of the Spirit hovering over the
waters, of the names of the Egyptian magicians which,
together with Pliny, he hands down to posterity. He
also was said to have told many stories about Jesus,
in an allegorical manner.</p>

<p>The Christian origins in Stoicism have been widely
discussed; for instance, by Chaignet. But it is likely
that this influence affected Christianity indirectly
through Plotinos, along with the other Christian ideas
we shall later find. At any rate Plotinos is the philosopher
who uses the term "spiritual body" most like the
<span class="locked">Christians.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a></span> The soul is a slave to the <span class="locked">body,<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a></span> and has
a celestial <span class="locked">body<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a></span> as well as a spiritual <span class="locked">body.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a></span> Within
us are two men opposing each <span class="locked">other,<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a></span> the better part
often being mastered by the worse part, as thought St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1309" id="Page_1309">1309</a></span>
<span class="locked">Paul,<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a></span> in the struggle between the inner and outer
<span class="locked">man.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a></span></p>

<p>With Plotinos the idea of "procession" is not only
cosmic but psychological. In other words, when
Plotinos speaks of the "procession" of the God-head,
he is not, as in Christian doctrine, depicting something
unique, which has no connection with the world.
He is only referring to the cosmic aspect of an evolution
which, in the soul, appears as educational <span class="locked">development.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></span>
As the opposite of the soul's procession
upwards, there is the soul's descent into <span class="locked">hell,<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a></span> or, in
other words, the soul's descent and <span class="locked">ascension.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a></span> This
double aspect of man's fate upward or downward is
referred to by Plotinos in the regular Christian term
"sin," as consisting in missing one's <span class="locked">aim.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a></span> The soul
<span class="locked">repents,<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></span> and its duty is <span class="locked">conversion.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></span> As a result of
this conversion comes <span class="locked">forgiveness.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></span></p>

<h3>OLD TESTAMENT REFERENCES.</h3>

<p>The famous "terrors of <span class="locked">Jeremiah"<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a></span> might have
come mediately through the Gnostics, who indeed may
have been the persons referred to as <span class="locked">Christians.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a></span>
More direct no doubt was God admiring his <span class="locked">handiwork<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a></span>
and the soul breathing the spirit of life into
<span class="locked">animals.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a></span> God is called both the "I am what I am"<a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a>

<h3>NEW TESTAMENT REFERENCES.</h3>

<p>Plotinos says that it would be a poor artist who
would conceive of an animal as all covered with eyes.
There is hardly such a reference outside of <span class="locked">Revelations,<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a></span>
to which we must also look for a new heaven
and a new <span class="locked">earth.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a></span> Then we have practically a quotation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1310" id="Page_1310">1310</a></span>
of the Johannine prologue "In the beginning was
the Logos," and by him were all things <span class="locked">made.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a></span> Light

mansions in heaven for good <span class="locked">souls.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a></span></p>

<p>Pauline references seem to be that sin exists because
of the <span class="locked">law.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a></span> God is above all height or <span class="locked">depth.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a></span>

God is the father of <span class="locked">lights.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a></span></p>

<p>However, the most interesting incident is that
scriptural text which, to the reflecting, is always so
much of a puzzle: "If the light that is in them be darkness,"
<span class="locked">etc.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a></span> This is explained by the Platonic
<span class="locked">theory<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></span> that we see because of a special light that is
within the eye.</p>

<h3>THEOLOGICAL REFERENCES.</h3>

<p>General theological references may be grouped
under three heads: the soul's salvation, the procession
of the divinity, and the trinity.</p>

<p>As to the soul's salvation, God is the opposite of the
evil of <span class="locked">beings,<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a></span> which, when created in honor of the
<span class="locked">divinity<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a></span> is the image of the Word, the interpreter of
the <span class="locked">One,<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a></span> and is composed of several <span class="locked">elements;<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a></span>
but it is a fall from <span class="locked">God,<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a></span> and its fate is connected
with the "parousia."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1311" id="Page_1311">1311</a></span><a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a></p>

<p>This going forth of the soul from God, when considered
cosmically, becomes the "procession of the
<span class="locked">soul."<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a></span> This is the "eternal <span class="locked">generation,"<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a></span> whereby
the Son is begotten from <span class="locked">eternity,<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a></span> so that there could
be no (Arian) "ên hote ouk ên," or, "time when he
was <span class="locked">not."<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a></span> This is expressed as "light of <span class="locked">light,"<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a></span> and
explained by the Athanasian light and ray <span class="locked">simile.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a></span>
We find even the Johannine and Philonic distinction
between God and the <span class="locked">Good.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a></span> The world is the <span class="locked">first-begotten,<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a></span>
and the Intelligence is the logos of the
first <span class="locked">God,<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a></span> as the hypostasis of wisdom is "ousia," or
<span class="locked">"being,"<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a></span> and it is the "universal <span class="locked">reason."<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a></span></p>

<p>As to the trinity, Plotinos is the first and chief
rationalizer of the cosmic trinity, which he continuously
and at length <span class="locked">discusses.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a></span> God is father and <span class="locked">son,<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a></span>
and they are "homoousian," or <span class="locked">"consubstantial."<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a></span>
The human soul (as image of the cosmic divinity), is
one nature in three <span class="locked">powers.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a></span> Elsewhere we have
discussed the history of the term "persons," but we
may understand the result of that process best by
Plotinos's simile of the trinity as one head with three
<span class="locked">faces,<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a></span> in which the "persons" bear out their original
meaning of masks, "personare." Henceforward the
trinity was an objective idea.</p>

<h3>NOTE</h3>

<p class="smaller">Although mentioned above, special attention should be given
to the parable of the vine and the branches (iii. 3.7.&mdash;48, 1088
with Jno. xv. 1&ndash;8), and the divinity's begetting a Son (v. 8.12&mdash;31,
571). The significant aspect of this is that it is represented
as being the content of the supreme ecstatic vision; what you
might call the crown of Plotinos' message. "He tells us that
he has seen the divinity beget an offspring of an incomparable
beauty, producing everything in Himself, and without pain preserving
within Himself what He has begotten.... His Son
has manifested Himself externally. By Him, as by an image
(Col. i. 15), you may judge of the greatness of His Father ...
enjoying the privilege of being the image of His eternity."</p>

<h2>VII. PLOTINOS'S INDEBTEDNESS TO
NUMENIUS.</h2>

<h3>1. HISTORICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN NUMENIUS
AND PLOTINOS.</h3>

<p>We have, elsewhere, pointed out the historic connections
between Numenius and Plotinos. Here, it
may be sufficient to recall that Amelius, native of
Numenius's home-town of Apamea, and who had
copied and learned by heart all the works of Numenius,
and who later returned to Apamea to spend his declining
days, bequeathing his copy of Numenius's works
to his adopted son Gentilianus Hesychius, was the
companion and friend of Plotinos during his earliest
period, editing all Plotinos's books, until displaced by
Porphyry. We remember also that Porphyry was
Amelius's disciple, before his spectacular quarrel with
Amelius, later supplanting him as editor of the works
of Plotinos. Plotinos also came from Alexandria,
where Numenius had been carefully studied and quoted
by Origen and Clement of Alexandria. Further, Porphyry
records twice that accusations were popularly
made against Plotinos, that he had plagiarized from
Numenius. In view of all this historical background,
we have the prima-facie right to consider Plotinos
chiefly as a later re-stater of the views of Numenius,
at least during his earlier or Amelian period. Such a
conception of the state of affairs must have been in
the mind of that monk who, in the Escoreal manuscript,
substituted the name of Numenius for that of Plotinos
on that <span class="locked">fragment<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a></span> about matter, which begins directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1314" id="Page_1314">1314</a></span>
with Numenius's name of the divinity, "being and <span class="locked">essence."<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a></span></p>

<h3>2. NUMENIUS AS FATHER OF NEO-PLATONISM.</h3>

<p>Let us compare with this historical evidence, that
which supports the universally admitted dependence of
Plotinos on his teacher Ammonius. We have only two
witnesses: Hierocles and Nemesius; and the latter
attributes the argument for the immateriality of the
soul to Ammonius and Numenius jointly. No doubt,
Ammonius may have taught Plotinos in his youth; but
so no doubt did other teachers; and of Ammonius the
only survivals are a few pages preserved by Nemesius.
The testimony for Plotinos's dependence on Numenius
is therefore much more historical, as well as significant,
in view of Numenius having left written records that
were widely quoted. The title of "Father of Neo-platonism,"
therefore, if it must at all be awarded,
should go to Numenius, who had written a "History of
the Platonic Succession," wherein he attempts to restore
"original" Platonism. This fits the title "Neo-platonism,"
whereas the philosophy of Ammonius,
would be better described as an eclectic synthesis of
Platonism and Aristotelianism.</p>

<h3>3. CONTRAST BETWEEN THEM.</h3>

<p>Of course we shall admit that there are differences
between Plotinos and Numenius, at least during his
Porphyrian period; this was inevitable while dismissing
his Numenian secretary <span class="locked">Amelius,<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a></span> a friend "who had
become imbued with" such doctrines before becoming
the friend of Plotinos, who persevered in them, and
wrote in justification thereof. We find that the book
chronologically preceding this one is v. 5, on the very
subject at issue between Amelius and Porphyry.
Plotinos took his stand with the latter, and therefore
against the former, and through him, against Numenius;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1315" id="Page_1315">1315</a></span>
and indeed we find him opposing several Gnostic
opinions which can be substantiated in Numenius: the
creation by illumination or <span class="locked">emanation,<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></span> the threefoldness
of the <span class="locked">creator,<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a></span> and the pilot's forgetting himself
in his <span class="locked">work.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a></span></p>

<p>But, after all, these points are not as important as
they might seem; for in a very little while we find
Plotinos himself admitting the substance of all of these
ideas, except the verbiage; he himself uses the light
and ray simile, the "light of <span class="locked">light;"<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a></span> he himself distinguishes
various phases of the allegedly single <span class="locked">intelligence,<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a></span>
and the soul, as pilot of the body incarnates
by the very forgetfulness by which the creator <span class="locked">created.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a></span></p>

<p>Further, as we shall show, during his last or Eustochian
period after Porphyry had taken a trip to Sicily
to avoid suicide, he himself was to return to Numenian
standpoints. This may be shown in a general way as
follows. Of the nine Eustochian <span class="locked">essays<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a></span> only <span class="locked">two<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a></span>
betray no similarities to Numenian ideas, while <span class="locked">seven<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a></span>
do. On the contrary, in the Amelio-Porphyrian
<span class="locked">period,<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a></span> written immediately on Amelius's dismissal,
only <span class="locked">six<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></span> are Numenian, and <span class="locked">six<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a></span> are non-Numenian.
In the succeeding wholly Porphyrian <span class="locked">period,<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></span> we have
the same equal number of <span class="locked">Numenian<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a></span> and <span class="locked">non-Numenian<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></span>
books. An explanation of this reversion
to Numenian ideas has been attempted in the study
of the development in Plotinos's views. On the whole,
therefore, Plotinos's opposition to Numenius may be
considered no more than episodic.</p>

<h3>4. DIRECT INDEBTEDNESS OF PLOTINOS TO
NUMENIUS.</h3>

<p>As Plotinos was in the habit of not even putting
his name to his own notes; as even in the times of
Porphyry the actual authorship of much that he wrote
was already disputed; as even Porphyry acknowledges
principles and quotations were borrowed, we must discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1316" id="Page_1316">1316</a></span>
Numenian passages by their content, rather
than by any external indications. As the great majority
of Numenius's works are irretrievably lost, we may
never hope to arrive at a final solution of the matter;
and we shall have to restrict ourselves to that which,
in Plotinos, may be identified by what Numenian fragments
remain. What little we can thus trace definitely
will give us a right to draw the conclusion to much
more, and to the opinion that, especially in his Amelian
period, Plotinos was chiefly indebted to Numenian
inspiration. We can <span class="locked">consider<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a></span> the mention of
Pythagoreans who had treated of the intelligible as
applying to Numenius, whose chief work was "On the
Good," and on the "Immateriality of the Soul."</p>

<p>The first class of passages will be such as bear explicit
reference to quotation from an ancient source.
Of such we have five: "That is why the Pythagoreans
were, among each other, accustomed to refer to this
principle in a symbolic manner, calling him 'A-pollo,'
which name means a denial of <span class="locked">manifoldness."<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a></span> "That
is the reason of the saying, 'The ideas and numbers are
born from the indefinite doubleness, and the One;' for
this is <span class="locked">intelligence."<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a></span> "That is why the ancients said
that ideas are essences and <span class="locked">beings."<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a></span> "Let us examine
the (general) view that evils cannot be destroyed, but
are <span class="locked">necessary."<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a></span> "The Divinity is above <span class="locked">being."<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a></span></p>

<p>A sixth case is, "How manifoldness is derived from
the <span class="locked">First."<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a></span> A seventh case is the whole passage on
the triunity of the divinity, including the term
<span class="locked">"Father."<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a></span></p>

<p>Among doctrines said to be handed down from the
ancient <span class="locked">philosophers<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a></span> are the ascents and descents of
<span class="locked">souls<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a></span> and the migrations of souls into bodies other
than <span class="locked">human.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a></span> The soul is a <span class="locked">number.<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, Plotinos wrote a book on the Incorruptibility
of the <span class="locked">soul,<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a></span> as Numenius had <span class="locked">done;<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a></span> and both
authors discuss the incorporeity of <span class="locked">qualities.<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these passages where there is a definite expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1317" id="Page_1317">1317</a></span>
of dependence on earlier sources, there are
two in which the verbal <span class="locked">similarity<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a></span> is striking enough
to justify their being considered references: "Besides,
no body could subsist without the power of the universal
Soul." "Because bodies, according to their own
nature, are changeable, inconstant, and infinitely divisible,
and nothing unchangeable remains in them, there
is evidently need of a principle that would lead them,
gather them, and bind them fast together; and this we
name <span class="locked">soul."<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a></span> This similarity is so striking that it had
already been observed and noted by Bouillet. Compare
"We consider that all things called essences are
composite, and that not a single one of them is simple,"
with "Numenius, who believes that everything is
thoroughly mingled together, and that nothing is
simple."<a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a></p>

<h3>5. UNCERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS OF PLOTINOS.</h3>

<p>As Plotinos does not give exact quotations and
references, it is difficult always to give their undoubted
source. As probably Platonic we may mention the
passage about the universal Soul taking care of all that
is <span class="locked">inanimate;<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a></span> and "When one has arrived at individuals,
they must be abandoned to <span class="locked">infinity."<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a></span> Also
other <span class="locked">quotations.<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a></span> The line "It might be said that
virtues are <span class="locked">actualizations,"<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a></span> might be Aristotelian. We
also <span class="locked">find:<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a></span> "Thus, according to the ancient maxim,
'Courage, temperance, all the virtues, even prudence,
are but purifications.'" "That is the reason that it is
right to say that the 'soul's welfare and beauty lie in
assimilating herself to the divinity.'" This sounds
Platonic, but might be Numenian.</p>

<p>In this connection it might not be uninteresting to
note passages in Numenius which are attributed to
Plato, but which are not to be identified: "O Men, the
Mind which you dimly perceive is not the First Mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1318" id="Page_1318">1318</a></span>
but before this Mind is another one, which is older and
diviner." "That the Good is <span class="locked">One."<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a></span></p>

<p>We turn now to thoughts found identically in Plotinos
and Numenius, although no textual identity is to
be noted. We may group these according to the subject,
the universe, and the soul.</p>

<h3>6. PARTICULAR SIMILARITIES.</h3>

<p>God is supreme <span class="locked">king.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a></span> Eternity is now, but neither
past nor <span class="locked">future.<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a></span> The King in heaven is surrounded
by <span class="locked">leisure.<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a></span> The Good is above <span class="locked">Being;<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a></span> the divinity
is the unity above the "Being and <span class="locked">Essence;<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a></span> and
connected with this is the unitary interpretation of the
name <span class="locked">A-pollo,<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a></span> following in the footsteps of Plutarch.
Nevertheless, the inferior divinity traverses the
<span class="locked">heavens,<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a></span> in a circular <span class="locked">motion.<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a></span> While Numenius
does not specify this motion as <span class="locked">circular,<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a></span> it is implied,
inasmuch as the creator's passing through the heavens
must have followed their circular course. With this
perfect motion is connected the peculiar Numenian
doctrine of inexhaustible <span class="locked">giving,<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a></span> which gave a philosophical
basis for the old simile of radiation of <span class="locked">light,<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a></span>
so that irradiation is the method of <span class="locked">creation,<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a></span> and
this is not far removed from emanationism. This process
consists of the descent of the intelligible into the
material, or, as Numenius puts it, that both the intelligible
and the perceptible participate in the <span class="locked">ideas.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a></span>
Thus intelligence is the uniting principle that holds
together the bodies whose tendency is to split up, and
<span class="locked">scatter,<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a></span> making a leakage or <span class="locked">waste,<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a></span> which process
invades even the <span class="locked">divinity.<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a></span> This uniting of scattering
elements produces a mixture or <span class="locked">mingling,<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a></span> of matter
and <span class="locked">reason,<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a></span> which, however, is limited to the
energies of the existent, not to the existent <span class="locked">itself.<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a></span>
All things are in a <span class="locked">flow,<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a></span> and the whole all is in <span class="locked">all.<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a></span>
The divinity creates by glancing at the intelligence
<span class="locked">above,<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a></span> as a <span class="locked">pilot.<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a></span> The divinity is split by over-attention
to its charges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1319" id="Page_1319">1319</a></span><a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a></p>

<p>This leads us over to consideration of the soul. The
chief effort of Numenius is a polemic against the materialism
of the Stoics, and to it Plotinos devotes a
whole <span class="locked">book.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a></span> All souls, even the lowest, are <span class="locked">immortal.<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a></span>
Even qualities are <span class="locked">incorporeal.<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a></span> The
soul, therefore, remains <span class="locked">incorporeal.<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a></span> The soul, however,
is <span class="locked">divisible.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a></span> This explains the report that Numenius
taught not various parts of the <span class="locked">soul,<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a></span> but two
souls, which would be opposed by Plotinos in his
polemic against the <span class="locked">Stoics,<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a></span> but taught in another
<span class="locked">place.<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a></span> Such divisibility is indeed implied in the
formation of presentation as a <span class="locked">by-product,<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a></span> or a
"common <span class="locked">part."<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a></span> Moreover, the soul has to choose
its own demon, or guardian <span class="locked">divinity.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a></span> Salvation as a
goal appears in <span class="locked">Numenius,<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a></span> but not in Plotinos, who
opposes the Gnostic idea of the "saved <span class="locked">souls,"<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a></span>
though elsewhere he speaks of the paths of the <span class="locked">musician,<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a></span>
<span class="locked">lover<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a></span> and <span class="locked">philosopher<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a></span> in reaching
<span class="locked">ecstasy.<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a></span> Still both Gnostics and Plotinos insisted on
the need of a <span class="locked">savior.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a></span> Memory is actualization of the
<span class="locked">soul.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a></span> In the highest ecstasy the soul is alone with
the <span class="locked">alone.<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a></span></p>

<h3>7. SIMILARITIES APPLIED DIFFERENTLY.</h3>

<p>This comparison of philosophy would have been
much stronger had we added thereto the following
points in which we find similar terms and ideas, but
which are applied differently. The soul is indissolubly
united to intelligence according to Plotinos, but to its
source with <span class="locked">Numenius.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a></span> Plotinos makes discord the
result of their fall, while with Numenius it is its <span class="locked">cause.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a></span>
Guilt is the cause of the fall of souls, with <span class="locked">Plotinos,<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a></span>
but with Numenius it is impulsive passion. The great
evolution or world-process is by Plotinos called the
"eternal procession," while with Numenius it is <span class="locked">progress.<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a></span>
The simile of the pilot is by Plotinos applied
to the soul within the body; while with Numenius, it
refers to the logos, or creator in the <span class="locked">universe,<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a></span> while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1320" id="Page_1320">1320</a></span>
in both cases the cause,&mdash;of creation for the <span class="locked">creator,<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a></span>
and incarnation for the <span class="locked">soul<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a></span>&mdash;is forgetfulness. There
is practically no difference here, however. Doubleness
is, by Plotinos, predicated of the sun and stars, but by
Numenius, of the demiurge <span class="locked">himself,<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></span> which Plotinos
opposes as a Gnostic <span class="locked">teaching.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a></span> The Philonic term
"legislator" is, by Plotinos, applied to intelligence,
while Numenius applies it to the third divinity, and not
the <span class="locked">second.<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a></span> Plotinos extends immortality to animals,
but Numenius even to the inorganic realm, including
<span class="locked">everything.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a></span> While Numenius seems to believe in
the Serapistic and Gnostic <span class="locked">demons,<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a></span> Plotinos opposes
<span class="locked">them,<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a></span> although in his <span class="locked">biography<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a></span> he is represented
as taking part in the evocation of his guardian spirit
in a temple of Isis.</p>

<p>We thus find a tolerably complete body of philosophy
shared by Plotinos and Numenius, out of the
few fragments of the latter that have come down to
us. It would therefore be reasonable to suppose that
if Numenius's complete works had survived we could
make out a still far stronger case for Plotinos's dependence
on Numenius. At any rate, the Dominican scribe
at the Escoreal who inserted the name of Numenius in
the place of that of Plotinos in the heading <span class="locked">of<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a></span> the
fragment about matter, must have felt a strong confusion
between the two authors.</p>

<h3>8. PHILOSOPHICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN NUMENIUS
AND PLOTINOS.</h3>

<p>To begin with, we have the controversy with the
Stoics, which, though it appears in the works of both,
bears in each a different significance. While with
Numenius it absorbed his chief controversial <span class="locked">efforts,<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a></span>
with <span class="locked">Plotinos<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a></span> it occupied only one of his many
spheres of interest; and indeed, he had borrowed from
them many terms, such as "pneuma," the spiritual
body, and others, set forth elsewhere. Notable, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1321" id="Page_1321">1321</a></span>
was the term "hexis," habituation, or form of
inorganic <span class="locked">objects,<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a></span> and the "phantasia," or <span class="locked">sense-presentation.<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a></span>
Like, them, the name A-pollo is interpreted
as a denial of <span class="locked">manifoldness.<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a></span></p>

<p>Next in importance, as a landmark, is Numenius's
chief secret, the name of the divinity, as "being and
essence," which reappears in Plotinos in numberless
<span class="locked">places.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a></span> Connected with this is the idea that essence
is <span class="locked">intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a></span></p>

<h3>9. PYTHAGOREAN SIMILARITIES.</h3>

<p>It is a common-place that Numenius was a
Pythagorean, or at least was known as such, for
though he reverenced Pythagoras, he conceived of himself
as a restorer of true Platonism. It will, therefore,
be all the more interesting to observe what part numbers
play in their system, especially in that of Plotinos,
who made no special claim to be a Pythagorean disciple.
First, we find that numbers and the divine ideas
are closely <span class="locked">related.<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a></span> Numbers actually split the unity
of the <span class="locked">divinity.<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a></span> The soul also is considered as a
<span class="locked">number,<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a></span> and in connection with this we find the
Pythagorean sacred <span class="locked">"tetraktys."<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a></span> Thus numbers split
up the <span class="locked">divinity,<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a></span> though it is no more than fair to add
that elsewhere Plotinos contradicts this, and states that
the multiplicity of the divinity is not attained by <span class="locked">division;<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a></span>
still, this is not the only case in which we
will be forced to array Plotinos against himself.</p>

<p>The first effect of the splitting influence of numbers
will be <span class="locked">doubleness,<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a></span> which, though present in <span class="locked">intelligence,<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a></span>
nevertheless chiefly appears in <span class="locked">matter,<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a></span>
as the Pythagorean "indefinite <span class="locked">dyad."<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a></span> Still, even
the Supreme is <span class="locked">double.<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a></span> So we must not be surprised
if He is constituted by a <span class="locked">trinity,<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a></span> in connection with
which the Supreme appears as <span class="locked">grandfather.<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></span></p>

<p>If then both Numenius and Plotinos are really under
the spell of Pythagoras, it is pretty sure they will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1322" id="Page_1322">1322</a></span>
be materialist, they will believe in the incorporeality of
the <span class="locked">divinity,<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a></span> of <span class="locked">qualities;<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a></span> and of the <span class="locked">soul<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a></span>
which will be <span class="locked">invisible<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a></span> and possess no <span class="locked">extension.<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a></span>
A result of this will be that the soul will not be located
in the body, or in space, but rather the body in the
<span class="locked">soul.<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a></span></p>

<p>From this incorporeal <span class="locked">existence,<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a></span> there is only a
short step to unchangeable <span class="locked">existence,<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a></span> or <span class="locked">eternity.<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a></span>
This, to the soul, means <span class="locked">immortality,<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a></span> one theory of
which is <span class="locked">reincarnation.<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a></span> To the universe, however,
this means <span class="locked">harmony.<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a></span></p>

<p>There are still other Pythagorean traces in common
between Numenius and Plotinos. The cause that the
indeterminate dyad split off from the divinity is "tolma,"
rashness, or <span class="locked">boldness.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a></span> Everything outside of
the divinity is in a continual state of <span class="locked">flux.<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a></span> Evil is
then that which is opposed to <span class="locked">good.<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a></span> It also is therefore
unavoidable, inasmuch as suppression of its cosmic
function would entail cosmic <span class="locked">collapse.<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a></span> The
world stands thus as an inseparable combination of intelligence
and necessity, or <span class="locked">chance.<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a></span></p>

<h3>10. PLATONIC TRACES.</h3>

<p>Platonic traces, there would naturally be; but it will
be noticed that they are far less numerous than the
Pythagorean. To begin with, we find the reverent
spirit towards the divinities, which prays for their
blessing at the inception of all <span class="locked">tasks.<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a></span> To us who live
in these latter days, such a prayer seems out of place
in philosophy; but that is only because we have divorced
philosophy from theology; in other words, because our
theology has left the realm of living thought, and,
being fixed once for all, we are allowed to pursue any
theory of existence we please as if it had nothing whatever
to do with any reality; in other words, we are
deceiving ourselves. On the contrary, in those days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1323" id="Page_1323">1323</a></span>
every philosophical speculation was a genuine adventure
in the spiritual world, a magical operation that
might unexpectedly lead to the threshold of the cosmic
sanctuary. Wise, indeed, therefore, was he who
began it by prayer.</p>

<p>Of other technical Platonic terms there are quite a
few. The lower is always the image of the <span class="locked">higher.<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a></span>
So the world might be considered the statue of the
<span class="locked">Divinity.<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a></span> The ideas are in a realm above the
<span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a></span> The soul here below is as in a <span class="locked">prison.<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a></span>
There is a divinity higher than the one generally
<span class="locked">known.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a></span> The divinity is in a stability resultant of
firmness and perfect <span class="locked">motion.<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a></span> The perfect movement,
therefore, is <span class="locked">circular.<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a></span> This inter-communion
of the universe therefore results in matter appearing
in the intelligible world as "intelligible <span class="locked">matter."<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a></span> By
dialectics, also called "bastard <span class="locked">reasoning,"<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a></span> we abstract
<span class="locked">everything<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a></span> till we reach the <span class="locked">thing-in-itself,<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a></span>
or, in other words, matter as a substrate of the
<span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a></span> Thus we metaphysically reach ineffable
<span class="locked">solitude.<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a></span></p>

<p>The same goal is reached psychologically, however,
in the <span class="locked">ecstasy.<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a></span> This idea occurred in Plato only as
a poetic expression of metaphysical attainment; and
in the case of Plotinos at least may have been used as
a practical experience chiefly to explain his epileptic
attacks; and this would be all the more likely as this
disease was generally called the "sacred disease."
Whether Numenius also was an epileptic, we are not
told; it is more likely he took the idea from Philo, or
Philo's oriental sources; at least Numenius seems to
claim no personal ecstatic experiences such as those of
Plotinos.</p>

<p>We have entered the realm of psychology; and this
teaches us that that in which Numenius and Plotinos
differ from Plato and Philo is chiefly their psychological
or experimental application of pure philosophy. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1324" id="Page_1324">1324</a></span>
body could subsist without the soul to keep it <span class="locked">together.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a></span>
Various attempts are made to describe the
nature of the soul; it is the extent or relation of circumference
to <span class="locked">circle.<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a></span> Or it is like a line and its
<span class="locked">divergence.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a></span> In any case, the divinity and the soul
move around the <span class="locked">heavens,<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a></span> and this may explain the
otherwise problematical progress or evolution ("prosodos"
or "stolos") of <span class="locked">ours.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a></span></p>

<h3>11. VARIOUS SIMILARITIES.</h3>

<p>There are many other unclassifiable Numenian traces
in Plotinos. Two of them, however, are comparatively
important. First, is a reaffirmation of the ancient
Greek connection between generation, fertility of birth
of souls and <span class="locked">wetness,<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a></span> which is later reaffirmed by
Porphyry in his "Cave of the Nymphs." Plotinos, however,
later denies <span class="locked">this.<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a></span> Then we come to a genuine
innovation of Numenius's; his theory of divine or intelligible
giving. Plato had, of course, in his genial,
casual way, sketched out a whole organic system of
divine creation and administration of this world. The
conceptions he needed he had cheerfully borrowed
from earlier Greek philosophy without any rigid systematization,
so that he never noticed that the hinge
on which all was supposed to turn was merely the
makeshift of an assumption. This capital error was
noticed by Numenius, who sought to supply it by a psychological
observation, namely, that knowledge may be
imparted without diminution. Plotinos, with his winning
way of dispensing with quotation-marks, appropriated
<span class="locked">this,<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a></span> as also the idea that life streams out
upon the world in the glance of the divinity, and as
quickly leaves it, when the Divinity turns away His
<span class="locked">glance.<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a></span></p>

<p>Other less important points of contact are: the
Egyptian ship of <span class="locked">souls;<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a></span> the Philonic distinction between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1325" id="Page_1325">1325</a></span>
"the" God as supreme, and "god" as <span class="locked">subordinate;<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a></span>
the hoary equivocation on <span class="locked">"kosmos;"<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a></span>
and the illustration of the divine Logos as the pilot of
the <span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VALUE_OF_PLOTINOS" id="VALUE_OF_PLOTINOS">VALUE OF PLOTINOS.</a></h2>

<h3>IMPORTANCE IN THE PAST.</h3>

<p>We must focus our observations on Plotinos as a
philosopher. To begin with, we should review his
successors, Porphyry, Jamblichus, Sallust, Proclus, Hierocles,
<span class="locked">Simplicius;<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a></span> <span class="locked">Macrobius;<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a></span> Priscus; Olympicdorus
and John <span class="locked">Philoponus.<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Arabian philosophers that follow in his
steps are Maimonides and Ibn <span class="locked">Gebirol.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Christian fathers we first have two who
paraphrased, rather than quoted him.</p>

<p>St. Augustine by name quotes i. 6; iii. 2; iv. 3, and
v. 1; he paraphrases parts of i. 2; ii. 1; iii. 6, 7; iv. 2,
7; vi. 5, <span class="locked">6.<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a></span> St. Basil so closely paraphrases parts of
Plotinos in his treatise on the Holy <span class="locked">Spirit,<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a></span> his letter
on the Monastic <span class="locked">Life,<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a></span> and his <span class="locked">Hexameron,<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a></span> that
Bouillet prints the passage in question in deadly
parallel.</p>

<p>Other Christian Plotonic students were Gregory of
Nyssa, Synesius, Dionysius the Areopagite, Theodorus,
Aeneas of Gaza, <span class="locked">Gennadius;<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a></span> <span class="locked">Victorinus;<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a></span> Nicephorus
<span class="locked">Chumnus;<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a></span> and <span class="locked">Cassiodorus.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas Aquinas also was much indebted to Plotinos;
and after him came Boethius, Fénélon, Bossnet and
Leibnitz (all quoted in Bouillet's work).</p>

<p>We have frequently pointed out that Plotinos'
"bastard reasoning" process of reaching the intelligible
was practically paraphrased by Kant's dialectical path
to the "thing-in-itself." This dialetic, of course, was
capitalized by Hegel.</p>

<p>Drews has shown that Edouard von Hartmann used
Plotinos' semi-devotional ecstasy as a metaphysical
basis for his philosophy of the Unconscious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1328" id="Page_1328">1328</a></span>
It is, of course, among mystics that Plotinos has
been accorded the greater honor. His practical influence
descended through the visions and ecstasies of
the saints down to Swedenborg, who attempted to
write the theology of the ecstasy; and the relation between
these two, Swedenborg and Plotinos should
prove a fertile field for investigation.</p>

<h3>CULTURAL IMPORTANCE.</h3>

<p>Summarizing, he formed a bridge between the pagan
world, with its Greco-Roman civilization, and the
modern world, in three departments: Christianity,
philosophy, and mysticism. So long as the traditional
Platonico-Stoical feud persisted there was no hope
of progress; because it kept apart two elements that
were to fuse into the Christian philosophy. Numenius
was the last Platonist, as Posidonius was the last Stoic
combatant. However, if reports are to be trusted,
Ammonius was an eclecticist, who prided himself on
combining Plato with Aristotle. If Plotinos was indeed
his disciple, it was the theory eclecticism that he
took from his reputed teacher. Practically he was to
accomplish it by his dependence on the Numenian
Amelius, the Stoic Porphyry, and the negative Eustochius.
It will be seen therefore that his chief importance
was not in spite of his weakness, but most because
of it. By repeatedly "boxing the compass" he
thoroughly assimilated the best of the conflicting
schools, and became of interest to a sufficiency of
different groups (Christian, philosophical and mystical)
to insure preservation, study and quotation. His
habit of omitting credit to any but ancient thinkers
left his own work, to the uninformed&mdash;who constituted
all but a minimal number&mdash;as a body of original
thought. Thus he remains to us the last light of
Greece, speaking a language with which we are
familiar, and leaving us quotations that are imperishable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1329" id="Page_1329">1329</a></span></p>

<h3>PERSONAL VALUE.</h3>

<p>While therefore providentially Plotinos has ever
been of great importance theologically, philosophically
and mystically, we cannot leave him without honestly
facing the question of his value as an original thinker.
It is evident that his success was in inverse ratio to
originality; but we can also see that he could not have
held together those three spheres of interest without
the momentum of a wonderful personality. This will
be evident at a glance to any reader of his biography.
But after all we are here concerned not so much with
his personality as with his value as an original thinker.
This question is mooted by, and cannot be laid aside
because of its decisive influence on the problem of his
dependence of Numenius. The greater part of the
latter's works being irretrievably lost, we can judge
only from what we have; and as to the rest, we must
ask ourselves, was Plotinos the kind of a man who
would have depended on some other man's thoughts?
Is he likely to have sketched out a great scheme and
filled it in; or rather, was he likely to depend on personal
suggestion, and embroider on it, so to speak.
Elsewhere we have demonstrated a development of his
opinions, for instance, about matter. Was this due to
progressiveness, or to indefiniteness? The reader must
judge for himself.</p>

<h3>PERSONAL LIMITATIONS.</h3>

<p>His epilepsy naturally created an opportunity for,
and need of a doctrine of ecstasy; which for normal
people should be no more than a doctrine, or at least
be limited to conscious experiences. Even his admirer,
Porphyry, acknowledges that he spelled and
pronounced <span class="locked">incorrectly.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a></span> He acknowledged that without
Porphyry's objections he would have nothing to
say. He refrained from quoting his authorities, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1330" id="Page_1330">1330</a></span>
Porphyry acknowledged that his writings contained
many Stoic and Aristotelian doctrines. It was generally
bruited around that his doctrines were borrowed from
<span class="locked">Numenius,<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a></span> to the extent that his disciples held controversies,
and wrote books on the subject. His style
is enigmatic, and the difficulty of understanding him
was discussed even in his own day. He was dependent
on secretaries or editors; first on Amelius, later on
Porphyry, who does not scruple to acknowledge he
added many <span class="locked">explanations.<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a></span> Later, Plotinos sent his
books to Porphyry in Sicily to edit. No doubt the
defectiveness of his eyesight made both reading and
writing difficult, and explains his failure to put titles
to his works; though, as in the case of Virgil, such
hesitation may have been the result of a secret consciousness
of his indebtedness to others.</p>

<h3>RELIANCE ON PUNNING.</h3>

<p>Punning has of course a hoary antiquity, and even
the revered Plato was an adept at it&mdash;as we see in his
Cratylos. Moreover, not till a man's work is translated
can we uncover all the unconscious cases of
"undistributed middle." Nevertheless, in an inquiry
as to the permanent objective validity of a train of
reasoning, we are compelled to note extent and scope
of his tendency. So he puns on <span class="locked">aeons;<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a></span> on science

these puns refer to some of the most important conceptions,
and are found in all periods of his life. We
must therefore conclude that his was not a clear thinking
ability; that he depended on accidental circumstances,
and may not always have been fully conscious
how far he was following others. This popular judgment
that he was revamping Numenius's work may
then not have been entirely unfounded, as we indeed
have shown.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he achieved some permanent work,
that will never be forgotten; for instance:</p>

<p class="num">1. His description of the ecstatic state.</p>

<p class="num">2. His polemic against the Aristotelian and Stoic
categories.</p>

<p class="num">3. His establishment of his own categories.</p>

<p class="num">4. His allegoric treatment of the birth of love, the
several Eroses, Poros and Penia, and other myths.</p>

<p class="num">5. His building of a Trinitarian philosophy.</p>

<p class="num">6. His threefold spheres of existence, underlying
Swedenborgian interpretation.</p>

<p class="num">7. His aesthetic theories.</p>

<p class="num">8. His ethical studies of virtues and happiness.</p>

<p class="num">9. His restatement of Numenius's arguments for
the immateriality of the soul.</p>

<h3>SELECTED MAXIMS</h3>

<p>The reader may be interested in a few maxims
selected from Plotinos' works which may be of general
interest.</p>

<p class="num">1. We develop toward ecstasy by simplification of
Soul.</p>

<p class="num">2. We rise by the flight of the Single to the Single,
face to face.</p>

<p class="num">3. We contain something of the Supreme.</p>

<p class="num"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1332" id="Page_1332">1332</a></span></p>

<p class="num">4. The Soul becomes what she remembers and sees.</p>

<p class="num">5. Everything has a secret power.</p>

<p class="num">6. The best men are those who have most intimacy
with themselves.</p>

<p class="num">7. The touch of the good man is the greatest thing
in the world.</p>

<p class="num">8. Every being is its best, not when great or
numerous, but when it belongs to itself.</p>

<p class="num">9. There are two men in us, the better and the
worse.</p>

<p>10. The secret of life is to live simultaneously with
others and yourself.</p>

<p>11. God is the author of liberty.</p>

<p>12. Concerning what would it be most worth while
to speak, except the Soul? Let us therefore know
ourselves.</p>

<p>13. Without virtue, God is but a name.</p>

<p>14. The object of virtue is to separate the soul from
the body.</p>

<p>15. We can never become perfect, because he who
thinks himself so has already forgotten the supreme
divinity towards which he must hasten.</p>

<p>16. The world was created by a concurrence of intelligence
and necessity.</p>

<p>17. The Soul is the image, word, and interpreter of
the One.</p>

<p>18. The divinities though present to many human
beings often reveal themselves only to some one person,
because he alone is able to contemplate them.</p>

<p>19. To act without suffering is the sign of a great
power.</p>

<p>20. Only virtue is independent.</p>

<p>21. We are beautiful when we know ourselves.</p>

<p>22. The Soul is the child of the universal Father.</p>

<p>23. True happiness is being wise, and exercising this
within oneself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1333" id="Page_1333">1333</a></span>
24. To become again what one was originally is to
live in the Superior world.</p>

<p>25. The desired goal is not to cease failing, but to
grow divine.</p>

<p>26. Virtue demands preliminary purification.</p>

<p>27. Our effort at assimilation should be directed
not at mere respectability, but at the gods themselves.</p>

<p>28. One should study mathematics in order to accustom
oneself to think of incorporeal things, and to
believe in their existence.</p>

<p>29. Soul is not in body, but body in Soul.</p>

<p>30. The Soul's higher part remains in heaven.</p>

<p>31. We should not leave the earth, but not be of it.</p>

<p>32. The object of life is not to avoid evil, or copy
the good, but to become good.</p>

<p>33. Dying, to Eustochius: "I am awaiting you, in
order to draw the divine in me to the divine in all."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> It is significant that the
subject of the first treatise of
Plotinos, after the departure of
Porphyry, should treat of happiness
as the object of life.
These may have been the arguments
he advanced to persuade
Porphyry to abstain from
suicide (to which he refers in
sections 8, 16), and, rather, to
take a trip to Sicily, the land of
natural beauty. He also speaks
of losing friends, in section 8.
The next book, on Providence,
may also have been inspired
by reflections on this untoward
and unexpected circumstance.
We see also a change from
abstract speculation to his
more youthful fancy and comparative
learning and culture.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> A Stoic confutation of
Epicurus and the Gnostics. As
soon as Porphyry has left him,
Plotinos harks back to Amelius,
on whose leaving he had
written against the Gnostics.
He also returns to Numenian
thoughts. Bouillet notices that
here Plotinos founded himself
on Chrysippus, Marcus Aurelius,
and Epictetus, and was
followed by Nemesius. This
new foundation enabled him to
assume a rather independent
attitude. Against Plato, he
taught that matter derived existence
from God, and that the
union of the soul and body is
not necessarily evil. Against
Aristotle, he taught that God
is not only the final, but also
the efficient cause of the universe.
Against the Stoics, he
taught that the human soul is
free, and is a cause, independent
of the World Soul from
which she proceeded. Against
the Gnostics, he insisted that
the creator is good, the world
is the best possible, and Providence
extends to mundane
affairs. Against the Manicheans,
he taught that the evil
is not positive, but negative,
and is no efficient cause, so
that there is no dualism.</p></div>

Aristotle seems to
have been more interested in
natural phenomena and human
virtue than in the root-questions
of the destiny of the universe,

divinity; so Plotinos studies
him little here. But it will be
seen that here Plotinos entirely
returns to the later Plato,

studies of Plotinos do not take
up any new problems, chiefly
reviewing subjects touched on
before. This accounts for
Porphyry's attempt to group
the Plotinic writings, systematically.
This reminds us of
the suggestion in the Biography,
that except for the objections
of Porphyry, Plotinos
would have nothing to write.
Notice also the system of the
last Porphyrian treatises, contrasted
with the more literary
treatment of the later. All
this supports Porphyry's table
of chronological arrangement
of the studies of Plotinos.
This book is closely connected
with the preceding studies of
Fate and Providence, iii. 1&ndash;3;
for he is here really opposing
not the Gnostics he antagonized
when dismissing Amelius,

and Fate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_261" id="Footnote_261" href="#FNanchor_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> Plotinos is here harking
back to his very earliest
writing, 1.6, where, before his
monistic adventure with Porphyry,
he had, under the Numenian
influence of Amelius,
constructed his system out of
a combination of the doctrines
of Plato (about the ideas),
Aristotle (the distinctions of
form and matter and of potentiality
and actualization),
and the Stoic (the "reasons,"
"seminal reasons," action and
passions, and "hexis," or
"habit," the inorganic informing
principle). Of these, Numenius
seems to have lacked
the Aristotelian doctrines, although
he left Plato's single
triple-functioned soul for
Aristotle's combination of
souls of various degrees (fr.
53). Plotinos, therefore, seems
to have distinguished in every
object two elements, matter
and form (ii. 4.1; ii. 5.2).
Matter inheres potentially in
all beings (ii. 5.3, 4) and therefore
is non-being, ugliness, and
evil (i. 6.6). Form is the actualization
(K. Steinhart's
Melemata Plotiniana, p. 31; ii.
5.2); that is, the essence and
power (vi. 4.9), which are inseparable.
Form alone possesses
real existence, beauty
and goodness. Form has four
degrees: idea, reason, nature
and habit; which degrees are
the same as those of thought
and life (Porphyry, Principles
12, 13, 14). The idea is distinguished
into "idea" or intelligible
Form, or "eidos," principle
of human intellectual
life. Reason is 1, divine
(theios logos, i. 6, 2; the reason
that comes from the universal
Soul, iv. 3.10), 2, human
(principle of the rational
life, see Ficinus on ii. 6.2);
3, the seminal or generative
reason (principle of the life of
sensation, which imparts to the
body the sense-form, "morphé,"
3.12-end; Bouillet, i. 365).
Now reasons reside in the soul
(ii. 4.12), and are simultaneously
essences and powers (vi.
4.9), and as powers produce
the nature, and as essences, the
habits. Now nature ("physis")
is the principle of the vegetative
life, and habit, "hexis,"
Numenius, fr. 55, see ii. 4.16, is
the principle of unity of inorganic
things.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_268" id="Footnote_268" href="#FNanchor_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> Plotinos here
makes in the world-Soul a distinction
analogous to that obtaining
in the human one
(where there is a reasonable
soul, and its image, the vegetative
soul, see i. 1.8&ndash;12; iv. 4.
13, 14). Here he asserts that
there are two souls; the superior
soul (the principal
power of the soul, which receives
the forms from Intelligence
(see iv. 4.9&ndash;12, 35), and
the inferior soul (nature, or
the generative power), which
transmits them to matter, so as
to fashion it by seminal reasons
(see iii. 4.13, 14, 22, 27).
Bouillet, no doubt remembering
Plotinos's own earlier invectives
against those who
divided the world-soul (ii. 9.6),
evidently directed against Amelius
and the Numenian influence,
which till then he had
followed&mdash;tries to minimize it,
claiming that this does not
mean two different hypostases,
but only two functions of one
and the same hypostasis. But
he acknowledges that this
gave the foundation for Plotinos's
successors' distinction
between the supermundane and
the mundane souls (hyperkosmios,
and egkosmios). Plotinos
was therefore returning
to Numenius's two world-souls
(fr. 16), which was a necessary
logical consequence of his belief
in two human souls (fr.
53), as he himself had taught
in iii. 8.5. Plotinos objectifies
this doubleness of the soul in
the myth of the two Hercules,
in the next book, i. 1.12.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_317" id="Footnote_317" href="#FNanchor_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> Bouillet observes that this
book is only a feeble outline
of some of the ideas developed
in vi. 7, 8, and 9. The biographical
significance of this
might be as follows. As
in the immediately preceding
books Plotinos was harking
back to Numenius's doctrines,
he may have wished to reconcile
the two divergent periods,
the Porphyrian monism of vi.
7 and 8, with the earlier Amelian
dualism of vi. 9. This
was nothing derogatory to
him; for it is well known that
there was a difference between
the eclectic monism of the
young Plato of the Republic,
and the more logical dualism
of the older Plato of the Laws.
This latter was represented by
Numenius and Amelius; the
former&mdash;combined with Aristotelian
and Stoic elements&mdash;by
Porphyry. Where Plato
could not decide, why should
we expect Plotinos to do so?
And, as a matter of fact, the
world also has never been
able to decide, so long as it
remained sincere, and did not
deceive itself with sophistries,
as did Hegel. Kant also had
his "thing-in-itself"&mdash;indeed, he
did little more than to develop
the work of Plotinos.</p></div>

<p class="in0 center">By <i>Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie</i>, <i>A. M.</i>, Harvard, <i>Ph. D.</i>, Tulane.</p>

<p>This is a lucid, scholarly systematization of the views of Plotinos,
giving translation of important and useful passages. It is preceded
by a careful indication and exposition of his formative influences,
and a full biography dealing with his supposed obligations to
Christianity. Accurate references are given for every statement and
quotation. The exposition of, and references on Hermetic philosophy
are by themselves worth the price of the book.</p>

<p>Dr <i>Harris</i>, U.S. Commissioner of Education has written about
it in the highest terms. Dr. <i>Paul Carus</i>, Editor of the <i>Open
Court</i>, devoted half a page of the July 1897 issue to an appreciative
and commendatory Review of it. Among the many other strong
commendations of the work are the following:</p>

<p class="in0 p1 center">From <i>G. R. S. Mead</i>, Editor <i>The Theosophical Review</i>, London:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It may be stated, on the basis of a fairly wide knowledge of the subject, that the
summary of our anonymous author is the CLEAREST and MOST INTELLIGENT
which has as yet appeared. The writer bases himself upon the original text,
and his happy phrasing of Platonic terms and his deep sympathy with Platonic
thought proclaim the presence of a capable translator of Plotinos amongst us....</p>

<p>To make so lucid and capable a compendium of the works of so great a giant
of philosophy as Plotinos, the author must have spent much time in analysing the
text and satisfying himself as to the meaning of many obscure passages; to test his
absolute accuracy would require the verification of every reference among the hundreds
given in the tables at the end of the pamphlet, and we have only had time to
verify one or two of the more striking. These are as accurate as anything in a digest
can rightly be expected to be. In addition to the detailed chapters on the seven
realms of the Plotinic philosophy, on reincarnation, ethics, and æsthetics, we have
introductory chapters on Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and Emanationism,
and on the relationship of Plotinos to Christianity and Paganism.</p>

<p>Those who desire to enter into the Plotinian precincts of the temple of Greek
philosophy by the most expeditious path CANNOT do BETTER than take this
little pamphlet for their guide; it is of course not perfect, but it is undeniably THE
BEST which has yet appeared. We have recommended the T.P.S. to procure a
supply of this pamphlet, for to our Platonic friends and colleagues we say not only
YOU SHOULD, but YOU MUST read it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Human Brotherhood, Nov. 1897</span>, in a very extended and most commendatory
review, says: TOO GREAT PRAISE COULD HARDLY BE BESTOWED
upon this scholarly contribution to Platonic literature.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Concordance Issues</h3>

<p>Entries in the Concordance have not been systematically checked for accuracy; some
errors have been corrected, but others probably remain. Detected errors are
noted below.</p>

<p>Links were added for primary refererences (numbers in parentheses, connected with dashes)
and for some entries lacking primary references.
Those links have been checked for validity (their targets exist) but not for accuracy (they
may refer to the wrong targets). Many of these links refer to pages in the other
three volumes at Project Gutenberg. Whether or not those external links will work
depends on the device and program used to display this eBook.</p>

<p>Most "see"-type references to other entries in the Concordance have not been linked because
their targets could not be reliably determined.</p>

<h3 id="fnissues">Footnote Issues</h3>

<p>In these notes, "anchor" means the reference to a footnote, and "footnote" means
the information to which the anchor refers. Anchors occur within the main text,
while footnotes are grouped in sequence at the end of this eBook. The structure
of the original book required some exceptions to this, as explained below.</p>

<p>The original text used chapter endnotes. In this eBook, they have been combined into
a single, ascending sequence based on the sequence in which the footnotes (not the
anchors) occurred in the original book, and placed at the end of the main text,
just before the Concordance.</p>

<p>Four kinds of irregularities occurred in the footnotes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Some footnotes are referenced by more than one anchor, so two or more anchors
may refer to the same footnote.</li>

<li>Some anchors were out of sequence, apparently because they were added afterwards
or because they are share a footnote with another anchor. They have been renumbered
to match the numbers of the footnotes to which they refer.</li>

<li>Some footnotes have no anchors. These are noted below.</li>

<li>One footnote was misprinted beyond repair, and the next three footnotes were
missing. These are noted below.</li>
</ol>

<p>Page 1076: Footnote <a href="#Footnote_61">61</a> (originally 42) has no anchor; the missing anchor would be
in page range <a href="#Page_1062">1062</a>&ndash;1064.</p>

<p>Page 1121: Footnote <a href="#Footnote_100">100</a> (originally 4) has no anchor; the missing anchor would be
in page range <a href="#Page_1091">1091</a>&ndash;1093.</p>

<p>Page 1121: Footnote <a href="#Footnote_103">103</a> (originally 7) has no anchor; the missing anchor would be
in page range 1094&ndash;1097. Anchor <a href="#FNanchor_99">99</a> (originally 3) on page <a href="#Page_1094">1094</a> could be the
missing anchor, as that number also is used on page <a href="#Page_1091">1091</a>.</p>

<p>Page 1188: Footnote <a href="#Footnote_210">210</a> (originally 13) has no anchor; the missing anchor would be
on page <a href="#Page_1171">1171</a> or <a href="#Page_1172">1172</a>.</p>

<p>Page 1189: Footnote <a href="#Footnote_226">226</a> (originally 29) has no anchor; the missing anchor would be
on page <a href="#Page_1174">1174</a> or <a href="#Page_1175">1175</a>.</p>

<p>Page 1253: Footnote <a href="#Footnote_329">329</a> (originally 9) has no anchor; the missing anchor would be
in page range <a href="#Page_1219">1219</a>&ndash;1226.</p>

<p>Page 1287: Footnote <a href="#Footnote_469">469</a> (originally 98) has no anchor; the missing anchor would be
on page <a href="#Page_1287">1287</a>.</p>

<p>Page 1333: Footnote <a href="#Footnote_758">758</a> (originally 21) appears to be misprinted, and the
next three footnotes 759&ndash;761 (originally 22&ndash;24) are missing.</p>
